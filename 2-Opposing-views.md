# Part 1

## Psychosis crisis

> [!NOTE]
> This was about 5 - 8 months after the hair loss. No prior history of psychosis or mania.

An ambulance found me, wet with brook water<!--, potentially at risk of frostbite-->. The only answer I gave as to what happened, was "for pleasure," here and thereafter, still under the delusional belief that my mom's life was in danger if I didn't adhere to that secrecy.

## Rochester General Hospital (RGH)

### Christmas Eve/Day, 2018

By chance, my psychosis happened from the morning of Christmas Eve to the morning/night of Christmas day, 2018 when the ambulance found me. By chance, since my only reason for doing this, the unspecified <!--self-endangering--> ordeal, was fear that my mom's life was in danger, and whether it was a Christian holiday or not was irrelevant to me since my family is Jewish by ethnicity and was secular. 

My interest in the I Ching began in the House on May St., when I heard of it by chance through hearing again a lecture from [Terence McKenna](https://youtu.be/9E5eBqG0cds?si=AZVe2xQMEci2s7Rr), who I used to enjoy in college. It resonated because of the randomness-dependent theory I had, and I ordered a Richard Wilhelm translation and copy as well as some Feng Shui coins. 

A nurse was there to help thaw my legs to prevent hypothermia and frostbite.  My legs were thawed in some machine and my mom arrived. I was still afraid her life was in danger, but I didn’t say anything. I didn't talk much.

The nurse remarked on some damages I had. 

### Catatonia, or "swallowing my tongue"

Then in a different bed, while doctors or nurses or attendants were in the room, I felt some strange thing happen with my tongue and throat, like my tongue was going back into it: my mouth opened wide, and it was like I swallowed my tongue, the whole [Kundalini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini) that had "risen."

I went into a conscious yogic surrender of all muscle due to a command from those [yogic grace guidances](#sarah) to do so, even as the doctors pushed and wheeled my limp body forward to the MRI machine.

Then my sister arrived to the room I was in next, and she saw me, and touched my arm, aware I wasn't unconscious, in contrast to the doctor's or attendant's reassurance.

A couple days later, an injection of benzos brought me out of the yogic state sooner than I'd planned to stay in it, as I became carefree to the earlier perceived responsibility. 

### Discharge from RGH

I also gave the "for pleasure" answer to the psychiatrist, who diagnosed me with a bipolar manic episode and catatonia.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> "Bipolar mania" could perhaps be clinically regarded as accurate. "Catatonia" was a misdiagnosis, due to me not knowing the definition of "catatonia," the fear for my mom if I elaborated on what actually happened, the <!--physical--> ability to have exited it, the yogic trance/grace/guidance that I was adhering to only due to fear of my mom dying which is not the same as "catatonia," and the difficulty of articulating what happened so soon after/amid the psychosis in the first place.

I ran the final experiments for my [MHDPA innovation paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) within just days of that, fully out of that altered state of consciousness now, in the hospital since the hospital staff allowed my mom to bring my laptop in.

Then RGH discharged me not much more than one week after admission.

More than two weeks since the first hospitalization, I end up not sleeping all night. My sister happened to visit the next day. Due to having not slept all night, she was worried I might be going through another "manic" episode and insisted to my mom and me to drive me to Strong Hospital. The doctors there didn't question the prior mania nor catatonia, nor ask for any further details about that earlier hospitalization or the events that led up to it.

## The unsampled world at Clover St.

My sister came to our apartment and brought my mom and I to her dark-red mid-size crossover, that I thought looked like a car that symbolized the Devil. Compared to the cars my mom and I drove, it was much newer, much nicer. She was working as a nurse at the time and making a middle class income. My mom was working two jobs with a low income, and I was a doctoral student making less than my state's legal living wage.

When we were driving, I remember we stopped at Clover St., due to a red light, and some instinct told me to jump out. The feeling was ominous. But together with that ominous feeling, as the drive progressed, I sensed that a million worlds existed, and that all of them had evolved to converge to this one. So I sat somewhat reassured, in an uneasy anxiety, that what was happening will be okay. 

Except, the sense/vision/idea was wrong, this time. Instead of my fanciful ideas about quantum stochasticity in a single universe, I had this bizarre idea, specifically on this transit, about "Many worlds" — I know, how original. "Many worlds" is a standard interpretation in quantum physics, often an alternative to Copenhagen which also, like me, both usually and I guess in my version here, tends to assume a single universe.

In "Many worlds," or at least my version that I was conjuring up in my mind in the car, or I should say was pouring into my mind through a sheer awareness, everything that happened in the universe was evolved, through countless cycles of different trajectories, over cosmogenesis origins upon cosmogenesis origins, into the perfect exact happenings that were happening then. Now that's not really "Many worlds." That's one world, where it just cycles many times, like an AI training algorithm, and we just happen to be in the version that cycled in this way.

"Many worlds" is more nuanced. It says: there's a LOT of worlds — like at least 6. No, maybe a million. No, googolplex. Infinity! Undefined! And we're in this one, because "reasons."

Both of these theories/interpretations are wrong. But neglecting to explain why for now, I think either of these serve as an accessible way to quickly show that, even under a pretty standard physics interpretation, the possibility of "God" is not... I think the word I want to use is "not necessarily stupid."

I mentioned stochasticity in the universe's quantum mechanics. That means randomness. The universe, as it's theorized today, is fundamentally probabilistic. And physics does a great job of telling us that those probabilities are probabilities. No no, just look at Schrödinger’s quantum wave function. See, it's a bunch of probability densities that splash around like a kiddie pool. And when those waves are especially high, that's where the particle is more likely to get sampled, or that's the more likely velocity of the particle, or that's the more likely "World" that gets sampled, or in my especially terrible vision, that's the "Cycle" that the universe just permanently converges to forever. 

So where can "God" fit into any of those interpretations, besides the last one being just "Godawful," no-pun-unintended (puns are deterministic)? Well, ultimately, something has to select which world gets chosen. One way that could happen is through just the magic power of randomness. Another way, is that some *will* known as "statistical divergence" is able to allocate the probable from the improbable, and, within its holy bounds, tilt the scales a bit. The "Sampler" — who is the "Sampler"?

I sensed an ominous feeling as we were driving, and that same inner sense that gave me that kind-of vision about the many cycling-evolving worlds converging to this moment’s exact perfection, told me to make a run for it when we stopped at Clover St., at a red light. My doctoral advisor, Henry, actually lived on Clover St.

My sister’s car was big and red, like a giant Dirt Devil, and before we got into it, I immediately had the "Devil" association, appear like a fear in my mind, the first omen (ominous sense) of that drive. Well, the "Sampler" that was about to sample my fate could only have been a little red vacuum cleaner, because, this transit, not specifically just this transit but this transit as well, was taking me to Hell, and the Devil drive did not end on Clover St., nor on the hospital grounds. No, each ticking moment from the drive to the psychiatric unit, even back to home, was a cruise controlled, speed-limit-obeying, insidious, maybe even pleasant drive, deeper, into Hell, to a Hell of mind that only one door leaves.

But at this time, we were stopped on Clover St. And there was my doctoral advisor’s big house, on this street, that I could’ve, hypothetically, run to, in one of the many other worlds. 

My advisor, Henry Kautz, was the most successful man I knew, and his house, I thought, was a mansion (though honestly the one I had on May St. probably would've been preferable).

As my sister must’ve thought, I’d be getting just standard quality care. What a lucky day. What a lucky world that was sampled. And then we proceeded, from Clover St., to the first day of my benzo nightmare. 

## University of Rochester's Strong Hospital

### Sarah

After the Christmas, 2018 trauma, I wasn’t able to access my meditation anymore. The mystical phenomenon I physically sensed was stunted. Those Kundalini sensations, and the complete transcendence of my psyche, stopped. 

It was like the breath that had been passing through my system had gotten locked into some bigger entity, that was asymmetrical, overly strong, and just leaning to one side. 

> [!NOTE]
> I felt, ever since that sensation that my tongue was going back into my throat, some vestibular situation — something really changed, and has been different since. That oceanic feeling that John Lennon captured really well about his experiences with TM in the song ["Across the Universe"](https://youtu.be/90M60PzmxEE?si=2n0PJKmeekYA6etl) ([John Lennon wrote the song about TM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe#Composition), both explicitly in his reference to "Jai guru deva om" and more ambiguously with his spot-on description of the state of consciousness induced by and during TM) was gone. Since that "catatonia" (tongue-throat situation), my experiences/words during and following TM weren't "like endless rain into a paper cup." They had become coarse somehow, and instead of that vibrant "Kundalini" movement I felt before, there was a physical feeling in my neck, a right-angle tilt, even when I wasn't meditating. I first began noticing this while trying to meditate in the hospital at RGH.

The meditation still relaxed me. I still felt less social anxiety afterwards. It still gave my thoughts more peace. But physically, it felt neither like bliss nor like a body part that I directly controlled. I couldn’t maneuver the breath, kundalini, blood circulation, whatever it was, through the different areas of my physical psyche, and my given mantra, that I repeated silently in my mind as part of the meditation, didn’t carry itself to the same places of silent acuity that it naturally and effortlessly did before, where rather than the hard sensation of speaking my inner voice that now characterizes my mantra’s audition, the mantra had before "melted," "sunk," become so soft until it literally couldn’t be heard and all of my thoughts were then fully adherent to both my will and my natural rhythm, yet silently, and no energy was lost no matter how verbosely or viscerally I thought then, and each one came like ["endless rain into a paper cup,"](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Universe%23:~:text%3DThe%2520flavour%2520of%2520the%2520song,the%2520link%2520to%2520the%2520chorus.&ved=2ahUKEwjGvszQ1rOIAxXlhIkEHdwgLcwQFnoECBsQAw&usg=AOvVaw1MtnfbSbXSsMu_w1lg6V_v) where just the right word, or visual or association, corresponded to both my will and my rhythm, beautifully, sometimes blissfully, sometimes catastrophically, maybe even orgasmically, quite organically. It was on that plane of consciousness that I'm trying to describe [that I wrote this paper.](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) 

[People mention the "inner monologue" vs. other types of thinking debate](https://www.iflscience.com/people-with-no-internal-monologue-explain-what-its-like-in-their-head-57739). That is a good analogy to the kind of consciousness transition I did while meditating, where my thoughts had become increasingly more acute, and were at the end, both. Both an awareness independent of words and words that perfectly matched that awareness, no matter how deep or intricate, then. And the awareness itself could carry far more information, and with each word (like ["endless rain into a paper cup"](https://youtu.be/90M60PzmxEE?si=2n0PJKmeekYA6etl)) less energy was used and no exhaustion would arise.

Now, some big lump pushed to the right of my throat and perhaps into my head, that same moving fist that was once an acute breath which circulated my chest, back, and head (or heart, back of throat, trachea/third-eye region/head).
 
The change began in RGH, not during the yogic state. The change began after they injected me with something, rapidly changed the fine balance of my body’s energies, and overwhelmed the sensitivity of a delicate state of consciousness with a much harder, much stronger, much less acute hospital one. The sudden change, including environmental and neurological, as they also "snapped me out" of that state rapidly with the injection of benzos, perhaps broke some endocrine or vestibular system of chakras and Kundalini that is unknown to (modern) science and medicine, locking my throat (maybe third eye or crown) "chakra" in some way that I since haven’t been able to unlock, again, in the same way. An Adam’s Apple, now lodged in my throat (and upper head, *maybe* nose/lobe region), like I choked on the wisdom that the higher nature forces gave me, from the House on May St., up to the inexplicable rapid psychosis when I was finishing up my [MHDPA paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) in 2018.
 
Part of what makes thoughts expressive through words is the intuitive feeling of some words as capturing the meaning and evoking some sense of the meaning. The brain makes those associations, and the faster it does so in line with our own will and rhythm, the more harmonious the mental state feels. But its suggestions can also take a life of their own, and after the House on May St., I found I was listening to intuitions that pointed to less rationalizable actions, with the awareness of their physical, visceral appearance in my consciousness and psyche; and so, in tandem with the profoundness of my research and research realizations, about long-term memory, relational reasoning and MHDPA, stochasticity in physics, there was no rational doubt that some profound consciousness phenomenon was being unlocked in tune with the context of what I was studying, and that gave that phenomenon — those intuitions and physical observations — unusual, perhaps even unprecedented, credibility. And I increasingly obeyed the guidance of them, less with my own intent, and more with the adherence to their "grace," their "wind," their threat. 
 
Additionally, I was using the I Ching, and the I Ching gave extraordinarily precise answers, answers that were too specific and relevant to be accident. In Rorschach tests, a person looks at ink blots and tells the psychoanalyst their associations. Dream interpretations are similar. But the answers I was getting from the I Ching weren’t just associatively relevant. They were specific, consistent, and profound. 

So besides a consciousness component, I interpreted physical phenomena to be happening in the universe’s physics, as I’d theorized earlier about the intelligence of quantum sampling. So not only did I have the visceral phenomena, and the intelligence research studies, but also direct answers from a randomness-dependent query book, and a rational mechanism for how such discriminatory actual interventions in the universe — while still respecting the predictable laws of physics currently known to science — could be possible. 

> [!NOTE]
> Is the I Ching really "randomness-dependent?" Well, it depends on decisions involving yarrow stalks or the casting of Feng Shui coins. Small-but-nonnegligible probabilistic divergences are hypothesized in quantum particles, which can bias physical matter collisions, and might have an evolved limited interplay in a person's consciousness with neurology/physiology, perhaps less limited depending on yogic attunement, thereby to some degree a person’s physical motor decisions. That of course raises many other questions, [that might have their own possible answers.](Philosophy/Consciousness.md)
 
That made the threats infinitely times more convincing, and as I transitioned from the House on May St., where I had independence and self respect, to my apartment without hair, without eyebrows and eyelashes, with even my fingernails purple and bending out of my nails, and social isolation and heavy workloads, including auxiliary ones that my advisor made me do like applying to the NSF GRFP (for which I got a "honorable mention," all excellent reviews, later after all this, one of them even writing, ["This is exactly the type of high-risk, high-reward research that the NSF is looking for to support,"](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ef2c97-c1d5-4333-9247-a0d28a689efb) except one that gave me a "good" instead of "excellent" because I didn’t have any publications to back up the peer-reviewed credibility of the research I was proposing, research that was about long-term memory primarily, but also relational reasoning and persistent memory), the "vibe" of my status as a person was marginalizing and "Gollum-esque," as I hid in a cave essentially, my last hairs dropping from my head, and worked. 
 
That "vibe" then commanded me in different ways. Rather than a social energy (or, I should write, "self-respecting energy," since I wasn't too social in the House on May St. either, and was also working really hard, but in a wealthier surroundings, with park and nearby nature and magical-cat-visitor and antiqueness in the aesthetic, to boot), the creativity of the energy went towards work, and the rest of it gradually became something else. I don’t want to describe it as anxiety. The anxiety appeared later, on that Christmas, 2018 day when I thought my mom was going to die, but until then it was beautiful, scary, but beautiful. 

> [!NOTE]
>
> I lived with guilt for this psychosis for a long time, for years, and now I'm actually proud, because it proved my bravery when my mom's life is at threat, or when a responsibility — in particular, from whatever probable forces somehow, and not trivially, convinced me — is perceived.

It was literally a wind that pushed me into the woods. 

I had left my apartment thinking my heightened energies were draining my mom, and walked through the snow aimlessly, but adhering to senses and what I thought were yogic grace guidances, to make a distance from her. Then I reached a road near the more commercial district, and then I turned towards the woods direction, and last second, I saw a man coming out of his car, and I shouted "Hey!" and I asked him if he had gloves, and he did and he gave them to me. 

Then, still not knowing I was going into the woods, a wind pushed me. A wind blew and I walked into those woods where I sat, in meditative silence, and peace, near a prettier part of the brook, thinking I had to stay there for a week, and if I did, my mom wouldn’t die. 

And I stayed there, completely immune to the cold, but protected, physiologically, by a single coat, sweatpants, and those gloves that were given me. 

Somehow, from the moment I'd left my apartment door, to the rest of this venture, except for a health concern, the cold didn’t feel too cold. My body, in this energy state, adapted so well. Humans have evolved mostly in the Ice Age. I cannot tell you the medical implications of how much power the body has. I was there, from the early morning I left to the rest of the day, in the cold, that through this extreme, psychotic/delusional, transcendent energy state didn’t faze me in the slightest, didn’t bite the way cold is thought to supposed to, and it varied — you see, every disobedience to the guidance of my energy state resulted in a physical grasp of me by the cold; I would shiver and shake, at increasingly extreme levels the more I stopped adherence. But as soon as I returned to adherence, the cold and the shaking stopped. 

This is not trivial. This reproducibly felt like a physical relationship between me and the cold, where had I disobeyed the exact adherence of my psychic state, the particles of the cold would (or I should say "did") get me. The shaking then wouldn’t even vary. It would appear in exact increment proportion to my deviation from the adherence to that mental state. 

Still daylight, the meaning of ["Life is suffering,"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-second-noble-truth/201609/existence-is-suffering) as it's colloquially said that the Buddha had said, decryptified to me: "Life itself, the source and the living, is currently suffering, in the world." I imagined grass dying as a symbolism for this interim worldly state of things. "Life is suffering," however, is not a permanent state or law of nature. It is the ongoing situation of life in the world.

It was at night, near 2 AM, 3 AM, or 4 AM when that terrible peace turned to horror.

> [!NOTE]
> The brook-jumping "baptism" could be interpreted as spiritual birth/rebirth, the throat sensations and tongue swallowing perhaps as Kundalini "rising," characterized in Hinduism as "spiritual awakening." Others independently describe [psychosis-type symptoms in Kundalini awakening](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9460011/), in Hindu tradition. The "yogic grace guidances," I'd interpreted, since the House on May St., as Tao. 

The I Ching had called those disruptions, the guidances that were navigating me, "Grace." And in Taoist philosophy, "Grace" isn’t necessarily good. Those winds, as they push us, are, to put it in Richard Wilhelm’s words, "beauty in form," and in the I Ching’s taxonomy, such a state to a person’s psyche and cosmology "has success in small matters […] but he dare not decide controversial issues in this way."

> [!NOTE]
> The I Ching gave this answer exactly the morning of the day before the Christmas Eve one that I left my apartment.

Perhaps this is what I was supposed to learn from the betrayal in my mind’s newly activated much-deeper-more-acute-intense intuitions. However, I suspect maybe something else as the mechanism, something in the collective consciousness, something that brought "Grace," as my work actualized into a paper and my body came to look ever more like Gollum’s — from extreme intelligence to extreme stupidity. 

In my second hospitalization, the environment was much better than RGH's. I made friends with Sarah, Hudson, and other inpatients. We [played](https://youtu.be/cco_DvSzrts?si=pmfrQ4XEaLF1teEK&t=51) Guitar Hero together, there was a piano, there were TVs, one of the public rooms had big windows, we even were taken across floors of the hospital for music jamming sessions with lots of instruments, they had their yoga and meditation instructions as well, and of all of my hospitalizations to come, this was perhaps the best care unit I was gated by armored vault into. 

Sarah’s sister’s name is "Kundalini Grace." I hadn’t heard of "Kundalini" until after I had those visceral, physical sensations in the House on May St. Then I looked up those sensations I was experiencing and found, for the first time, not having heard the word or of those movements and sensations before, the term "Kundalini," made more credible to me by the philosophy’s appreciation by the depth psychologist Carl Jung, who I was reading at the time, and whose views, very distinct from Freud's, on the existence of a subconscious, and its mystical-transcendent connection, helped explain some of what I was witnessing.  

Sarah Young’s last name is "Jung," she hadn't heard of Carl Jung, she and I kept observing synchronicities while we were there, and she kept a synchronicity list. To me, no synchronicities happened yet that were bigger than just the uncanny precision and specificity of the I Ching’s answers. However, I was still seeing some unambiguous synchronicities, as well as not seeing many others, including that the word "synchronicity" was actually coined by Jung, and now I was remarking on them  together with one Sarah "Jung." But there were more I hadn't seen, and more, much bigger, that would come.

The House on May St., in retrospect was one big synchronicity. I got the Facebook student housing page moderatorship just before I had to move out, and was able to deliver on my promise to fill my landlord’s house (and houses) with grad students. Not to mention, the house itself. Having that whole house, pretty much to myself, a beautiful antique house, for relatively pennies, the same house I had my AI and physics revelations — "luck" seems to forget a lot of context.

So the word "synchronicity" was already familiar, as was Jung, as was Kundalini, as was Grace, by the time Sarah and I met in the hospital. 

<!--
> [!NOTE]
> I define "synchronicity" as a "[teleological](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/exploring-authentic-leadership-teleology-vs-causality-utpal-dutta-d5w6f) connecting principle," somewhat distinct from [Jung’s analogous definition](https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=31992979134&ref_=pd_hw_o_1) of "synchronicity" as an "acausal connecting principle," in that I don't think that just because there is no known cause that there is not a cause, and that such a cause doesn't have a purpose, which is what (purpose) "teleology" refers to, and the link, by chance, refers to social healing.
-->

<!--
> [!IMPORTANT]

-->

We played Guitar Hero, I continued all of my meditation and yoga regimen, and my family, including my mom, uncle and aunt, and cousin brought in Paleo diet food for me, which I ate for my eczema but which also helped with my cognition, instead of the unhealthy processed type food of the hospital. And I shared crapes with Sarah<!--(another inpatient)-->, that my aunt brought in each time she and my uncle visited. They weren't 100% Paleo (buckwheat, goat cheese), but still delicious.

So to summarize, I was doing daily meditation, twice a day, daily yoga each morning, and eating a Paleo diet in the hospital, as well as now socializing well. On top of all of that, and antipsychotics, surely the missing ingredient to cure me would be an involuntary >6 months course of benzos.

My brother-in-law came in with my sister and I explained to him relational reasoning and the paper I submitted, the method of MHDPA. I explained to him the method underlying ChatGPT from my hospital ward 4 years before ChatGPT. And at the time, he thought my explanation was cool, but it’d’ve been hard to predict would be such a big thing, one that others in my field and the world would have heard of or have anywhere to as much belief in the utility in AI of, in the near-term or in the years to come. It was hard to predict for my professors and faculty, too. At the time, 2018/early-2019, most at the University of Rochester still thought deep learning was a fad. None of the professors or other PhD students were doing research on MHDPA, let alone had heard of MHDPA. [They might claim otherwise](4-Faith.md#academia--medicine). Besides the paper that proposed MHDPA itself, my innovation to MHDPA, was the first innovation to MHDPA ever, in the world/history. A small handful of others applied it, from research groups in DeepMind, none literally innovated *on* the method.

I showed my MHDPA innovation paper to Sarah. She was amazed that she could read it since usually, she said, that kind of stuff isn't readable, and brought up one more synchronicity. Her mom was a writer who had a published short story in a Stephen King anthology, a writer of horror. I was indeed in a hospitalization that was like a pretty good short story in an otherwise Stephen King anthology/horror. 

> [!NOTE]
> Sarah was early 20s, by chance hospitalized at the same time as me, also early 20s. She was a year older. That wasn't common.

Not that my lucidity needed further evidence, but I explained the methods of late-2022 ChatGPT to inpatient and visitors, in early-February, Winter, 2019, while drugs were altering and innovating on the functioning of my biological neural networks.

### Hudson

Our other companion was Hudson, who caught me as I was being discharged and handed me this letter in an envelope, that I opened later from my apartment:

<p align="center">
<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-12 at 8 10 34 PM" src="https://github.com/slerman12/Detective-Sam/assets/9126603/d5414cba-2012-42f9-b516-f06dd8760cad">
</p>

I'm impressed he was able to write at all. He had depression, was in the hospital for depression, was being treated for depression, was medicated for depression, and was electroshocked weekly, for depression. 

Meanwhile, I was being brain damaged by benzos, but who could’ve known that? (I did, because I made the case articulately, sufficiently so, to all of my psychiatrists. As I predicted, longer-term benzo use is dangerous, causes extreme physical dependence, and can result in unthinkable suffering). 

I was told a court order would be acquired if I didn't take them, even as I was taking antipsychotics.

# Part 2

How did I get here?

## House on May St.

My hair fell out while I lived in my *house on May St.*, a miraculous situation where the landlord — who I’d never met previously — rented me a 4-bedroom nice antique house near both the university and the park in Rochester where the Lilac Festival is held, to myself, for $600/month, starting Fall, 2017 — well, technically one bedroom from that house, but I had the whole place to myself pretty much for the next year, and even furnished at least one other bed from another room since, inexplicably and literally miraculously, the landlord didn't believe he could find anyone on his own without my help to rent out to, and he wanted grad students. 

It was beautiful, and even had a porch and balcony, big kitchen, a freezer for big-game hunting (this detail becomes funny later), basement, dishwasher, and laundry machine. Of some of the PhD students who visited me, some needed housing, and later the landlord and I showed them around the rooms (maybe not even prior to me furnishing any of the other bedrooms, which the landlord didn't mind that I'd done, seeing as my best friend and I also beautifully furnished that whole house together during one of my best friend's visits early when I moved in, really beautifully, and that increased the value of the house more, in addition to the sofa and tables and furnishings and beds and desks that the landlord provided — did I mention the word "miraculous" yet?), and one of them even mentioned to the landlord at the end having the funds to pay the full year's rent already — I don't remember why they ended up not moving in, but that was also clearly miraculous. I did end up renting out the attic (which was like a studio apartment, well, a giant room) to one of my friends from high school for the landlord after maybe 4 months of having the place to myself, and even then it was pretty much entirely my house, though he also set up a DJ station for himself in the basement since he threw raves (not in the house), and had his girlfriend over, but he kept quiet, and he wasn't a grad student, but the landlord had a strong belief in my judgement — again, a miraculous thing.

Pets weren't allowed, but that's okay, because there was a [semi-adopted stray who regularly came to visit me outside and sat with me on (or near) my porch named "Batman" (according to his collar)](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/KXoyjpZeM6tsKRrE/), and I loved him very much if the video doesn't make that clear.

Months before I moved out, I became the admin/moderator of the [university Facebook housing page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1112684565415024/) by chance, because the actual admin posted he was looking for a student to moderate the page for him, and I responded that I could do it. My landlord didn't know (and probably still doesn't) that I'm the effective-admin/moderator of that page. Also, since then, I've messaged the manager/admin of that group multiple times to give the moderation to someone else or moderate it himself and he hasn’t replied, and doesn't appear to use Facebook, so hereforth I'm permitting myself to call myself the admin. I’m glad to moderate, but not super good at keeping up to date with it. So, after there was no chance left of getting to keep the place to just myself and friend longer, I ended up finding University of Rochester grad students to fill all 4 bedrooms of the house, and all 4 bedrooms of the neighboring house, also belonging to the landlord — I think "semi-detached home" is what it's called — and, thanks to the ad I ended up posting ([here it is](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbe5ceff-3b06-4582-97fb-c13c30d00564)), I redirected inquiries to my landlord's email and my landlord's email flooded with other PhD students looking to fill that house, including one of the ones who’d originally wanted and planned to who I'd notified (he moved into the attached one). I ended up adding my landlord to that page, where, technically I'm not supposed to allow landlords, only students. Sorry for this phrasing, but the landlord’s house is now "never lacking" in interested grad students looking to rent from him. In fact, lucky for him, the neighboring commercial building is now [a herbal apothecary](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2019/09/19/little-apothecary-becomes-little-herbary-south-ave-rochester-ny/2365775001/), since it was abandoned when I lived there (due to, if I recall correctly, a murder, though I didn't know that moving in).

I also grew out a full beard <!--(except a really small patch probably from a lifetime of topical eczema creams, as my pediatrician told me was happening in high school or college)--> and full mustache mostly in those first months I lived in that May St. house, based on some intuition. [Here's a picture with my family at that house from my 22nd birthday](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1d366e-14bd-49cd-9a58-dca108e9a144), not too long after I started to grow it out. My best friend [visited me](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/c7m83bHR5v1mP4p4/) on December 15th, 2017 at that house and encouraged me to shave it (just before we went to a rave that day, the other friend's who would later move in with me, coincidentally), some months before Aetna cut me off from the prescription to Dupilumab, but it was the first time I ever grew out my facial hair.

I was working really hard in that house, developing my long-term memory research ideas and implementing the code for it there, meditating every day while practicing strict dietary (Paleo and organic) disciplines, practicing many asceticisms including not watching movies and TV shows, no unnatural lights after 8 PM except candlelight and always going to bed by 10 or 11, reading philosophy books and academic works for entertainment, cooking all of my food fresh, cold rather than hot showers (e.g., Wim Hof method), while working on campus taking full semesters of grad-level classes, and at the University of Rochester's Medical Center, building neural models to predict the progression of Parkinson's disease, and that house is where I started to get my idea for how stochasticity in the universe's quantum mechanics could explain a mechanism for "God" or some intelligent power in nature, hypothetically.

I was sleeping in one of the second bedrooms, when, on a rare occasion, my housemate friend and his girlfriend woke me climbing up the stairs. Somehow I had a sudden realization, near around 3 AM or whatever time it was in that night, that the universe's particles might be random, and therefore can be shifted by slight divergences by an intelligence — like the biological kind (or modeled by the artificial kind) — in such a way that still respects the known laws of physics and yet permits the possibility of an intelligent nature, that can modulate how those particles are sampled with respect to the sampling distributions.

In that house, somewhat before, and thereafter (continuing for years, mostly without pause), I was practicing many disciplines, including meditation, Paleo diet, and ascetic disciplines. I learned the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique from an instructor, while living there. The instructor I learned from through the TM program was trained directly by the creator/translator of the technique, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the guru/yogi the Beatles infamously learned their meditation practice from. I experienced the subtle sinking/melting of my state of consciousness, including visceral physiological sensations, perhaps what some people have observed/called as "Kundalini," that I hadn't heard of yet and came to from Googling my physical sensations, that were a movement in my chest, back of neck, maybe esophagus/throat region, or into my third eye/lobe region, visceral and physical. The meditation brought my consciousness to a sublime state and alleviated my social anxiety.

<!--
Later, after some time without that "Kundalini" sensation, I described how I theorized TM might work to another skeptical PhD student, my friend Mohsen, who'd actually visited me in that house and met "Batman" once, but on a hiking/camping/kayaking/hotel trip much later in the Adirondacks and Niagra Falls, that it had something to do with the distribution of processing systems in the brain. For example: attenuating to a mantra, reduces other area attention activity such that unconscious thinking processes can be allocated. However, while still in the house on May St., I had a different philosophy, involving my physical body, as well as associative and long-term memory —  but I can't remember what it was. I have notes in a small red journal (not a reference to Jung's "Red Book," but I was reading Jung at the time) [here](). To do: find journal and link photos
-->

<!--
The beard had a really small bald patch similar to places on my body where my skin was very smooth that my pediatrician (who I was still seeing in my Freshman year of college) diagnosed while I was a Freshman in college as probably due to the use of prescribed topical creams for eczema on those parts of my body. My chin is one of those areas where I got eczema and had applied those creams through high school and college. My head, eyelashes, armpits, and pubic area weren't.
-->

It was in that house when Aetna cut me off from Dupilumab and my hair started falling out.

After that house, I moved in with my mom to our apartment, where I came up with my [MHDPA innovation paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) (the method underlying ChatGPT) in 2018, and it was in the middle of wrapping up that that I was hospitalized (no prior history). It was actually in the first hospitalization, at RGH, where I ran the successful experiments for that paper, since the hospital staff had allowed my mom to bring in my laptop. It was in the second hospital, at the University of Rochester’s Strong Hospital, where I described relational reasoning to my brother-in-law and showed that paper to my fellow inpatient, Sarah (real name used with permission).

## Induced hair loss (*fellowship with man*)

In the summer immediately at the head of my first year as a PhD student, my university-hospital doctor Lisa Beck prescribed a medication called Dupilumab. It's a biologic agent that one injects into their stomach that laser-targets a specific antibody associated with eczema. My eczema was severe and debilitating. Some time into taking the medication — I think maybe 8 months — my university-provided health insurance Aetna cut me off from the drug without warning. I wasn't notified by Aetna or my doctor, or the university-owned hospital, but by the university-owned intermediary deliverer, who was responsible for delivering the drug on a recurring basis to my doorstep, since it can't — or at least at the time couldn't — be provided for pick-up at a pharmacy. They called me and told me they couldn't reach my doctor, but for some reason Aetna had decided to no longer cover the prescription. I remember walking up and down Mt. Hope Avenue with my phone in a panic calling my doctor trying to reach her, and the university deliverer telling me they were trying to do the same and couldn't reach her either. After a while, my hair started falling out rapidly. I have no genetic predisposition to baldness, from any side of my family. The abnormally rapid hair loss was obviously due to the dependency and cessation. 

Though it fell out quickly, I didn't notice at first. The shower drains were filled with hair every day, and I thought it was maybe my housemate's girlfriend's. I didn't get to see my doctor until later in the Spring (when she scheduled it), a long time after, when I think much of the side and top of my head were bald. She diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation of Dupilumab. To be clear, she diagnosed it as Alopecia Areata as a result of the sudden cessation<!-- of Dupilumab-->. She and her nurse took pictures and stored them in the university-hospital computers. 

Eventually, she sorted out things with the university-provided health insurance, but by then it was too late. Most of my hair had fallen out.

We finally got a delivery of the drug. I wasn’t sure whether it’d be safer at that point to re-instigate the dependency/addiction or avoid the drug at all costs.

Here's a personal story, since I was fixated with Taoism at the time:

To help me weigh the difficult decision — and it was difficult because that medication was extremely potent and didn't even help my eczema much, and I believed my hair would grow back — I asked the I Ching. Here I'll describe the hexagrams I got because I find it interesting that one of the predictions came true, and this might be medically useful since it corresponded thrice with my hair growing back (all three resurgences after the Alopecia Areata had developed into Alopecia Universalis, meaning after every piece of hair from my body had fallen out).

The I Ching "answered" it didn’t matter which of the two paths I chose ("The town may be changed, / But the well cannot be changed. / It neither decreases nor increases." - "The Well", unchanging). (Maybe an interesting observation: that the English "well" is phonetically similar to "wellness," as well). It also had previously "answered" my hair would grow back of its own accord, which it did, temporarily. I still remember: "Difficulty at the beginning" (as Richard Wilhelm described: "The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earth — hence the meaning, 'Difficulty at the beginning'.") $\rightarrow$ (changes to) "Fellowship with man" (e.g., baldness). That answer about whether my hair will grow back came true with the steak-only diet (steak is "manly" and so that again ties to the hexagram symbolism of "Fellowship with man"), almost like a suggestion for how my hair can "sprout" out of the earth, my head, like blades of grass, again... which it did, temporarily but covering my entire head except for an unnoticeable tiny spot at the top of my scalp.

Then all the hair fell out again. Again, total baldness. No eyelashes, eyebrows, or hair.

Another time I did the steak-only diet, my pubic hair fully grew back — temporarily.

Another time I did the steak-only diet, a few eyelashes grew back for the first time. 

That can't be a coincidence, so I leave this story here both for medical utility and for the understanding that [I now look like Gollum](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10211230008185126&set=a.1273659620707) because of medical malpractice.

> [!WARNING]
> By the way, the scariest nightmare I ever had, over and over that whole night, was the day I injected Dupilumab the first time. I remember my housemate at the time in the other room and I wanted to wake him. That's how scared I was. The nightmare was of a tall skinny slenderman, who kept approaching to "assault" me. Every time I closed my eyes and fell asleep, he'd reappear. Again and again, for that whole night. I never had a nightmare like that before. It was vivid.

## Psychiatry at the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital

I'm $5\text{'}5\text{'' } 110\text{lb}$.

I had a prescription for benzos before, Xanax, but for eczema and social anxiety, $\text{1/4}$ to $\text{1/2}$ of a milligram to be taken daily or as needed. I took them sometimes during my junior and senior years of college at the University of Rochester, as needed, usually for social anxiety, usually spaced out by more than two weeks, during the time when I took them at all, and they gave me small hangovers/dazes when the effect wore off. Knowing they were in a similar class of drugs to alcohol (see [below](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action)), I took them conservatively.

I had to stay in the University of Rochester's Strong Hospital for a month and take $48\text{x}$ that dosage, of the comparatively strong-per-duration-per-milligram Ativan, reduced later to $10\text{x}$ that dosage, over the course of $3$ times per day, every day, for that month and more than $5$ months after due to doctor-induced dependence and doctor-dependent tapering scheduling, the details of what was being treated still un-inquired about, incommunicable, and unbeknownst to them, solely derived from the medical record from RGH (see ["My trauma"](#my-trauma) for elaboration on this). Think about that. $\text{1/4}$ to $\text{1/2}$ of a milligram, once every two weeks at most (and usually much more rarely), had side effects. $48\text{x}$ $-$ $10\text{x}$ that dosage, but every day.

Accounting for dosage *and* rate, that’s a minimum $336\text{x}$ $-$ $70\text{x}$ &nbsp; to &nbsp; $672\text{x}$ $-$ $140\text{x}$ increase.

Just prior to this, the I Ching had answered to me about the reason for the less-than-ideal consciousness that rules humanity: "Difficulty at the beginning" $\rightarrow$ "Increase." My interpretation: Struggle among people from infancy or childhood, or at the outset of a crisis ("Difficulty at the beginning") $\rightarrow$ (changes to) Perpetual acceleration of interventions, or, more specifically, dependence of an individual, collective, or collective standards and systems on more mechanisms of intervention, rather than pause, substitution, remembrance, reconsideration, or decrease of all of what preceded ("Increase"). Yes, all the I Ching answers specified in this book were/are real. The crisis at the "beginning" can also be interpreted as, for example, one's hair no longer sprouting from one's head, or further yet back to simply eczema.

For the first three or so weeks, I was really, really drunk/high. Then the fog rolled in. The chemical waterboarding was taking effect.

[This link opens to a video with a different medical philosophy. It's worth clicking on, no matter one's skepticism.](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-)

I was also on antipsychotics, but these next chapters will not be about antipsychotics (see ["Geriatric unit hospitalization"](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization) for some elaboration on antipsychotics), since the benzos were added on top of them, making their evaluative efficacy compared to the damage from benzos hard to disentangle. The rest of this Part will be about the experience that was most-plausibly caused by the benzos.

<!-- <br><i><b>Note:</b> I finished making this diagram just as Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb" started playing on my Spotify, a song about a doctor taking a patient named "Pink"'s soul through "medicines" meant to help him. The next song was "Psycho Killer" which I'll interpret as psychiatric killer. Oh and then "Alabama  Song (Whisky Bar)." Not bad. Any song about alcohol is fitting for the topic of benzos, since they both work by GABA as the mechanism of action. In fact, I introduced a fellow hospital-inmate Sarah to Elliott Smith for the first time with the song "Between the Bars" (about alcohol... not about Xanax bars [Xanax is another benzo and "bars" is the colloquially and sometimes clinically used term for pills of them]) while we were in the hospital (between the bars of confinement).

## My trauma

My trauma revolves around three psychiatrists.

**PSYCHIATRIST 1:** "I will taper you off from the benzos. You will be tapered off *before* discharge."

> ``Psychiatrist 1 reassured, I'll be weaned off from the benzos,`` *before* ``discharge from the hospital.``

**PSYCHIATRIST 2:** "The tapering schedule is too fast (even though we decide when to discharge you) and the outpatient doctor, the psychiatrist after the hospitalization, will taper you off. You will be tapered off *right after* discharge."

> ``Psychiatrist 2  came in on the momentum of her previous post (to replace Psychiatrist 1), and changed the schedule, standing next to the first psychiatrist, who hesitantly, self-doubtingly told her that he'd planned to taper me off before the discharge since I was worried.``
>
> ``Maybe she didn't trust that I would continue with therapy if the physiological addiction didn't send me there by threat.``
>
> ``But she reassured, I'll be weaned off from the benzos,`` *right after* ``discharge from the hospital.``

**PSYCHIATRIST 3:** "Benzos can be safely taken for years. You need to take them. I want to increase the dose. Did you pull your hair out yourself?"

> ``I told Psychiatrist 3 my symptoms. He was cold, authoritative, and disbelieving. He only believed the benzos were needed. He argued that benzos could be safely taken for years. At no point for the next 5 months would he specify a tapering schedule, and I was begging him.``
> 
> ``He asked about my hair loss, whether I had pulled the hair out myself. He wouldn't believe me the first couple times I answered. Not only didn't I pull it out myself, but the medical system did, the one that was now making me answer repeatedly whether I did.``
> 
> ``I kept begging him to taper in later sessions as well, and he said if I was having all those negative symptoms, that we should increase the dose. That would've started a perpetual race against the brain's downregulation mechanisms. Psychiatrist 3 wanted to increase the dose.``

I argued against the benzos with all 3 psychiatrists.

With Psychiatrists 1 and 2, I only took them due to the threat of court order.

With Psychiatrist 3, I only took them due to (a) his recommendation and instruction, (b) the guilt about the earlier hospitalization, and me questioning even the most basic logic and instincts I perceived, while noticeably, adding extremely to the self-doubt, my brain was running slower than others due to the drug, thinking I really was sick in the way these doctors understood, (c) the mental impairment induced by the drug, and (d) insecurity about tapering off by myself, amid the severe physiological dependence.

Furthermore, they were treating a misdiagnosis, "catatonia" — that's what the benzos were prescribed for — that I never went through. I couldn't explain that to them because (a) I didn't know the definition of "catatonia" yet, and (b) the trauma of what I went through was too recent to summarize. 
> ``In RGH, they were prescribed due to that false diagnosis of "catatonia." The University of Rochester's Strong Hospital wanted to prevent a recurrence — that is, "preventatively" — threatened a court order if I didn't take them, and 3 psychiatrists changed, contradicted, and perpetually extended each other's scheduling for the taper.``

Additionally, maybe the most unbelievable part: they didn't ask about what I went through. They treated "catatonia" and "bipolar mania" as the indubitably exhaustive description. "Catatonia," which is what the benzos were meant to treat, was fully a misdiagnosis. The other diagnosis from the medical record was "bipolar mania," for which I was being given Risperdals, a strong antipsychotic, in addition to benzos. None of the previous diagnoses from the first hospitalization, none of what RGH wrote, were investigated or asked about in any extent by the University of Rochester’s psychiatrists.

Due to their practices, I was on benzos for >6 months. 

Symptoms from taking the benzos as prescribed included: 
- [Severe cognitive impairment](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/cdmid6/is_extreme_brain_fog_normal_before_even_beginning/)
- [Constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/)
- [Tinnitus](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/j1finq/tinnitus_in_just_left_ear/)
- Mouth dryness, and tooth calcification, as diagnosed as being due to benzos by dental hygienist
  - Chunks of what I thought were tooth were falling out after the benzos that she diagnosed as decalcification
- Severe generalized anxiety, previously undiagnosed
- [Severe social anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/)
- Inability to sleep due to anxiety
-  [Memory loss, and "greyness" of imaginative and creative ability](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/316ec47a-248e-4141-9eb7-5888bc1ea93d)
- [Severe loss of speech and writing quality](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/316ec47a-248e-4141-9eb7-5888bc1ea93d)
- [Severe pain](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/dyaf8n/constant_chest_pain_that_spikes_into_my_neck/)
- [Facial structure changed, wrinkled, and my face rapidly lost a healthy appearance](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) 
- Severe physiological dependence, which benzos cause more so, at least neurologically, than Dupilumab, which also causes/caused a physiological dependence
- PTSD from all of these symptoms and the recurrence of a malpractice-induced perhaps-permanent trauma
- [Scientifically-backed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10309976/) fear of permanent damage
- [More than a year of all of this, no sleep, non-stop persisting neurochemical torture](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cksl7u/health_disaster_brain_damage_alopecia_universalis/)

Almost nearing Fall, 2019, I tried to kill myself. The helium tank connected to tubing was found by my mom, and my family hid it from me.

A deeper summary of my benzo trauma can be found [here](#flying-colors). <!--[here](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/4399be6729f1369e27a3df35eef58fbfe94dcf23/2-Opposing-views.md#my-trauma).-->

The experience of losing my hair has cost me relationships and worsened my social anxiety, and the benzo-brain damage and torture leaves me with PTSD.

Let's begin a simplified explanation of the brain's neuron. Neurons are cells that are connected to one another by dendrites and axons that pass chemical messengers from one neuron to downstream neurons. The two most common chemical messengers in the brain are the excitatory neurotransmitter Glutamate and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Excitatory means they cause the next neuron to also release their neurotransmitters ("fire"). Inhibitory means they lower the voltage activity of the next neuron such that the next neuron is subdued. GABA is the mechanism of action of alcohol. People think alcohol is "disinhibitory," that it "disinhibits" them, but the reality is alcohol is actually inhibitory. It confuses GABA receptors, causing an inhibition of that neuron and all the neurons in your brain. It's a system-wide drug that indiscriminately simulates GABA throughout every part of your brain, from the Occipital lobe, where your eyes see (in the back of your head), to the frontal lobe, where your brain thinks it thinks.

The brain has evolved some countermeasure thanks to fermented fruit existing in nature.
<!--
Benzos are GABA agonists, like alcohol. That means they simulate GABA or enhance GABA receptor function. In response, the brain downregulates GABA production and receptor sensitivity universally across the brain, universally, from the parts that are understood to the parts that almost entirely aren't, including some of the most important regions of intelligence whose healthy metric level of functioning is extremely hard to measure behaviorally, clinically, and longitudinally across variants of factors, and necessary for quality living, e.g., the hippocampus responsible for long-term memory. Alcohol does this too, but humans have provably evolved natural mechanisms of recovering from small doses of alcohol thanks to fermented fruit existing in nature. Benzos seem like a Godsend, a Panacea, especially since you're less likely to feel a headache the next day from them for the same effect, but the [evidence isn't strong enough to support they're better on the brain in the long-term than alcohol](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/drugs-linked-to-brain-damage-30-years-ago-2127504.html). From what I've gathered, benzos are worse. Since it's somewhat relevant, [here](https://youtu.be/TEKgesBVTJ0?si=OtXQYMZgVd3Qu36M) is a video I made on evolutionary algorithms in deep learning.

Nobody understands this mechanism. To understand this mechanism, you'd have to solve all of neurology and artificial intelligence, and psychiatrists definitely haven't. Benzos are a floodbath of GABA, and your brain responds to those GABA bursts by "downregulation," even long, long after cessation.

Despite the similarities to alcohol, benzos are synthetic, achieve much the same effect without a person being able to notice the same short-term consequences like immediate hangover, and are often prescribed to be taken daily for long periods of time. [Studies haven't shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8629021/) that the long-term consequences are preferable to those of alcohol, and my experience was so severe that I would guess they are worse.

# Part 3

## Sam of Samarkand

Many Jews were executed, or tortured, or piled in bodies, when the Nazis occupied Ukraine. Ukraine was already sympathetic with Nazi anti-semitism before the occupation, but now Jews in droves fled to Russia, or Muslim nations to the East, a number of days train ride away, like Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan, for refuge. My grandpa's father, Yakob, couldn’t evacuate because he was drafted to fight in the warfront. My grandpa’s mom Maná, my grandpa’s younger sister Rosá, and my grandpa, Yury, who was about 13, fled to Kazakhstan together. At the end of the war, they returned to Chernihiv, Ukraine and reunited with Yakob. 

At the age of 16, my grandpa officially became "Yury," having been born with the Jewish name "Izya" and those documents being lost in the war, he went by the less-semitic name "Yury" in Ukraine, or the nickname "Yura."

My grandpa went to a college in Kiev; my grandma, Asya, who my grandpa had met before in childhood, a year older than him, went to a different college in Kiev. They met again and married. Then the Soviet Union assigned my grandpa to a job at a sheepskin manufacturing plant/factory in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, where my grandpa had to work there as a leather technology engineer. My grandma emigrated with him and found a job there as well, teaching German. So my grandparents emigrated from Kiev, Zhytomyr, or Chernihiv to Samarkand, in 1952.

The beautiful thing about Samarkand is that it’s an ancient Muslim city, with beautiful architecture, whose country is simultaneously Asia, Europe, and Middle Eastern, the closest geographical juncture to an intersection between the philosophical continents.

My uncle Slava was the first one born of their line, then my mom Nélya, both in Samarkand. Then, via my aunt Jenya, my older cousins Lena and Irina, and finally my older sister Marina, and I, all of us also in Samarkand, all of us also Ashkenazi Jews. My name, "Sam of Samarkand," happened entirely by chance, and in America, accidentally, by coincidence. I was named "Siímyon," after my grandma’s sister’s (Tslia’s) late husband Siímyon. He died several years before I was born. That’s the full name. "Syoma" is what I go by with my family. 

## Eczema at infancy (*difficulty at the beginning*)

I had severe eczema from a month and a half "age" old. I got this itchiness, and scratched myself, scratched myself to blood. I itched the whole body, cried, scratched myself, scratched, cried. My mom had to put cloths on my hands, babies’ cloths to cover my hands, so I’d not scratch to blood.

When I was 2, about 3, a family friend, Shafkad, said there is some man in some village, some far away village, who can treat people, a healer, a shaman, not a traditional healer, and he said he can take us there to see what this person can say or do; maybe he can heal me from eczema. He drove us there, and we went to some village, not-civilized-looking village. There, a man (a different man, not the healer) came, somebody Shafkad knew, and this man said, "I’ll take him to that healer. No you stay here." My mom wanted to go. "No. You not allowed." Maybe because she was a woman and it was Muslim, they didn’t let her go there. She was worried. Shafkad assured that everything is alright either way. He knows these people. "No no. They good people. They heal."

They were waiting and after some time, maybe 20 minutes, they brought me back, two people, the guy who took me and another, the shaman, healer, a short man, Uzbek or Tajik maybe, native-Uzbek looking, middle age, maybe 40 something, 50. He said he couldn’t heal me, that he got rid of all demons from me and couldn’t heal it. "Sorry. I couldn’t. I don’t know how to. I couldn’t help your son. I don’t know how to fix it." 

He didn’t take money. He just said, "I couldn’t heal him. I can’t."

The shaman somehow knew that we were immigrating. My mom didn’t know how. She thought maybe Shafkad told him. Somehow he knew. He said, "Are you going to America? Maybe they can heal him. They have better doctors there."

<!--The shaman somehow knew that we were immigrating. Maybe Shafkad told him — somehow he knew. My mom didn’t know how.-->

## PhD program

### Embassy interview

My grandma's sister, "Tsotya" Tsilia, and her son, my uncle Sasha, a mathematics professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), were the first to immigrate to America. My grandma, uncle, and mom applied for refugee status to immigrate as well. My grandparents and uncle’s family were approved, whereas my mom, sister, and I, weren’t. So my grandparents and uncle immigrated, and my grandparents sent an invitation to my mom through the embassy. My mom had to fly with us to Moscow, in January, to do an interview at the American Embassy in Moscow to convince them that she was subjugated. <!--My mom had to fly with us to Moscow, in the *freezing cold* of January — she couldn't move her hands in her gloves, they were so numb — to interview at the American Embassy in Moscow to convince them that she was subjugated so she could join her family.-->

"Your form said you have kids. Where are they?"

She had spent the whole day at the embassy, from early morning to night. She said, "I left them with relatives. I cannot bring them here. They would be suffering here. My youngest is 3. It would be torture for them here, without food, without sleep."

Jenya’s brother’s family lived in Moscow, so my mom was able to leave us with them while she went to the embassy to petition for refugee status.

"A lot of people bring their children here. They think that showing children to us will gain them sympathy, and pity."

"I thought I didn’t have to bring them. The documentation said we didn’t."

"Yes yes, you’re right," the interviewer said. "Why, to America, you're going?"

"I’m going to meet with my family, mom, dad, my brother is already there. I’m the only one left, with my children. My cousin, my brother, everyone is already there. And, second, because there is anti-semitism in Uzbekistan."

"What, in Uzbekistan, you suffered persecution?"

Anti-semitism in Uzbekistan wasn’t as bad as in other countries, she told me. In Ukraine, anti-semitism was always worse, from the war when my grandpa was young, to when my mom was an adult. <!--However, she told me, Jews customarily weren’t allowed to hold higher offices in Uzbekistan.-->

"I was at the conservatory. I wanted to study in a PhD program. I couldn’t. First, when I was a student, I wanted to continue my studies as a PhD student, but there wasn’t a chance for me, because I was Jewish."

She wasn’t allowed to do a doctoral, despite having graduated with a diploma with distinction for both college and in the conservatory of music where she earned her master's degree in Music Theory. Her thesis was recommended as the best research paper for publishing, recommended by a committee member who came from Russia to listen to the presentations, and she submitted it, but it was never published, because "Lerman" is a Jewish name, not Uzbek name.

She continued, "Jewish people don’t openly keep their traditions there, they don’t get good jobs/positions. I was professor teaching at music college. I had to stop working there last year [in 1998], because they reduced my hours, and not just me, but other Jewish people. Uzbeks they gave many." As a result, my uncle had found her a temporary job for an American firm instead, that had originally been offered to him, where she did indexing, tabulating, and auditing, nothing to do with music theory, despite having been a professor at the music college, respected and loved by her students.

To get refugee status, she had to argue to the interviewer that she deserved refugee status from Uzbekistan, a Muslim country, a Jewish woman <!--with a master's degree--> whose parents and brother already immigrated from Uzbekistan and were already approved by the same consulate for refugee status.
<!--
The interview ended.
-->

### Immigration

We flew to Rochester, New York, immigrating officially as Jewish refugees, half a year since the embassy interview. I was 3 and two thirds, and had cried, perhaps foretellingly, on the plane. My name, was legally mistranslated to "Semen." My mom (whose name was translated "Nellya") found a low-paying piano teaching job, and hoped to earn more money, so she got another degree, an associate's degree, at Monroe Community College, in Computer Information Systems, again [graduating with distinction](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6183641-3c06-4c82-ba4d-662d0be0dbba). So she ended up working multiple jobs, one as a piano teacher giving individual lessons for a piano studio, and another as a part-time computer tutor in two different labs at the community college where she received her associate’s degree. My mom's students loved her in America, too. My mom taught me how to program when I took my first-ever computer science class, at the University of Rochester, since the professor wasn’t good. In fact, he was really bad. She taught me, through quick intuition, object-oriented programming, and helped me with projects and labs in Java. 

7 semesters later, I [graduated](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ea5fb2f-7c92-48e0-87aa-4df7d7eb168c) with two bachelors degrees, in [Computer Science and Mathematics](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fe07066-f9ee-4e49-9016-60481d0d5e07). Thanks to work ethic and intelligence, that I inherited from my mom, and some luck, I got into a doctoral program.

Well, thanks also to my doctoral advisor, Henry.

Well, thanks also-also to my best friend, same one I mentioned before. He helped me edit together my statement of purpose and encouraged me as I took and re-took the GRE.

Unlike my mom not being able to in Uzbekistan, I got into the PhD program. I was gonna be a Doctor! I was gonna be the first Doctor of all of my *ancestors*, as far as I knew!

Before accepting me into his doctoral candidacy, Henry connected me to Charles Venuto at the Center for Health and Technology a year into their efforts to model Parkinson’s disease (PD) progression. Charles hired me as an undergrad researcher to work with another student, a friend of mine from an on-campus living community, in the UR Medicine Saunders Research Building, where I took on the responsibility of modeling Parkinson's disease for the next several years, including having co-led with that friend the PPMI Data Challenge project, a high-profile data contest hosted by the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which asked, "What factors at baseline predict clinical progression?"

Charles was my Med Center advisor.

<!--Henry recommended me to the position while I was still an undergrad, before the hair loss and benzo brain damage.--> 
Forebodingly, my research under Charles was neurodegenerative modeling. "Neurodegeneration" is when the brain degenerates, for example, due to severe GABA downregulation, as by prolonged chemical floodbaths of GABA from benzodiazepines (as study results have shown: ["current use at baseline was significantly associated with lower total brain volume as well as volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus"](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-024-03437-5)).

While I was working and researching under Charles, I had come up with, programmed, run the experiments for, and done most of the writing for the paper/contest-submission for a [disease prognostication machine learning model](https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModeling) that won top-three in the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research PPMI  contest, and came up with the idea of building a web app for the prognostication to give clinicians a clean, elegant interface. I had to argue a bit, and convince them, and then they let me, and, as a PhD student (in the early Fall of my third year, already in post-benzo withdrawal), [I even presented it at a conference in DC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b77731f5-c99a-42f3-a3c2-811cadeb38a2) in front of renowned researchers in the Parkinson's research field. Despite that being my idea and my [prototype](https://github.com/slerman12/DiseaseModelingWebApp), that I had to argue for, build, and present to make credible, all by myself (and while in severe withdrawal), they liked it so much that they hired a web development team to build one, didn't put me on that team, and since have never given me credit. Charles also said they were going to patent it having even contacted a patent lawyer, and since have given me no information or updates about that either, or attributions or royalties.

I hope Charles and his colleagues may find the above diagram (["5 Computational Neurons"](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action)) valuable in their work, ideally attributing credit. It elucidates original mechanisms of neurodegeneration biologically, computationally, and in psychiatric practice. 

<!--But before we come to the conclusion that Charles is caught "red-handed," he was very supportive as my advisor; and he was left-handed, I recall, like my grandpa.-->
Charles was very supportive as my advisor. And he was left-handed, I recall. My grandpa was also left-handed. On the website, though, Charles *and his bosses/team*, were, <!--technically,--> red-handed.

<!--
### Uncanny beard premonition

My grandpa actually gave me his razor, an electric razor. It was the first razor I ever had, that I used to shave in high school and all through college. I was right-handed; I'm sure my grandpa used his left hand; I'm sure Charles was startled when I started coming into the office at the Center for Health and Technology, in the late summer of 2017, with the early traces of a beard.

It was the [first time I grew out my beard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1d366e-14bd-49cd-9a58-dca108e9a144) and I did so out of an intuition, just before Aetna had cut me off from Dupilumab.

The top-three contest-winning Parkinson's disease progression models I built at the Med Center in college as an undergrad earned me a recommendation back to Henry Kautz, [as well as an embarrassing interview](https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/undergraduate-students-place-in-top-three-in-parkinsons-disease-data-science-contest-228912/). On top of that, I built [a sleek website interface for Twitter GNIP's involved data mining API](https://github.com/slerman12/TwitterDataCollector) for Henry's research group, and some sundry research projects together with one of his PhD students, and was praised by other affiliates of his that he recommended me to, at [Bryx emergency response](https://bryx.com). As a result of my skill, combined with appreciation for my extracurricular breadth, Henry accepted me into his PhD group as a doctoral student. 

### Fall, 2018 semester, and the Dead Marshes

- I first injected Dupilumab summer, 2017
- My first semester in the PhD program began in Fall, 2017, with Henry as advisor
- I lived in the [House on May St.](#house-on-may-st) for about a year, when, in 2018, Aetna cut me off from Dupilumab and my hair rapidly fell out

After the house on May St., it was from my mom's apartment (in 2018) during a video call with my advisor that I described that biologically-inspired neuron architecture [above](#benzodiazepine-benzos-mechanism-of-action), with the specifics in the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link) comparing it to the LSTM architecture.

I also presented a description of the LSTM cell, then layer, then network, then bidirectional layers with attention, to my Semantic Parsing class from the ground up using that [biological formulation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i5hS2iDVuo24PnGicvn5dIZYXUzDfPAl/view?usp=share_link). My fellow PhD student told me in our office that it was really original, and she liked how I didn't use the usual LSTM diagram. The class was impressed with me.

Also in that 2018 Fall semester, Henry made me apply for the NSF GRFP, one of the most competitive fellowships in the world. I submitted a personal background and research plan that got [excellent reviews](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ef2c97-c1d5-4333-9247-a0d28a689efb), with one of the reviewers writing, "This is exactly the type of high-risk, high-reward research that the NSF is looking for to support." I proposed my long-term episodic memory model, biological neuron, and relational reasoning via MHDPA to feed "relational concepts" into a long-term memory.

As I worked on the NSF GRFP submission, I kept asking the I Ching for advice, in addition to Henry, Sri Pai, and Charles Venuto. The former tended to give the most consistent, helpful answers, and for most of the writing process, very positive and encouraging. By the "former," I mean the I Ching, but the three professors also were encouraging, read my submissions, looked at different drafts, and helped. Their opinions contradicted each other, especially on the choice between two versions of the research plan I wrote, where Henry and Sri, both Computer Science, preferred one, and Charles and someone my age I liked, and I, preferred the other. I ended up going with the one the CS professors preferred. It was more structured and rigorous-looking, but less natural, profound, and lacked as much of a deeper philosophical meaning.

Towards the end of the submission, just when I was ready to submit my final versions, including that structured research plan that the CS professors liked, the I Ching's tone had gotten far more ominous in its answers, consistently, suddenly, no matter what I asked it, whether it was the choice between those versions of the research plan, or different edits I considered or came up with. Its predictions were all negative. I submitted what I had, since the deadline was that day, and the result ended up being a very unfortunate "honorable mention," wherein all of the reviews were excellent, except one "Good" that tilted the scale. The last's reasoning? I didn't have enough paper publications, as he'd "have expected" from someone with such an interesting submission. Otherwise, it was a good submission, but [without paper publications, he couldn't give me an "Excellent."](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ef2c97-c1d5-4333-9247-a0d28a689efb)

It was a lot of work, but concurrently, amid yet-other grad-level courses, I worked on my MHDPA innovation paper, as the semester project for the Semantic Parsing class. Neither Henry nor the professor had heard of MHDPA back then. Henry critiqued my use of the term "relational reasoning" to describe it, now the convention. Dan wrote that I wasn't clear on the math, and needed more equations. The amount of math I used fully described the method and was/is the convention.

But a strong interest or fascination with MHDPA, in 2018, didn't come by accident. Today, people who've heard of MHDPA have heard of it because of transformers, like the kind that underpins ChatGPT. In 2018, even an NLP professor whose students worked with deep learning models, including sequence-to-sequence attention models, as Dan was, was unlikely to have heard of transformers, let alone MHDPA, and of course Henry for that matter, since his background was in symbolic AI, and included little, if any, deep learning experience.
<!-- , and it was notable enough that he was one of the tenured professors in the CS department who believed deep learning wasn't a fad. -->

After the house on May St., I was coming up with and seeking a method that could do relational reasoning in deep learning. That is how I found MHDPA so early, before it had much recognition or almost any application (besides some groups at DeepMind) in the field. I was coming up with my own concept of relationally-attending-to image-features, and researching to find if anything existed in line with those principles, and (after [Relation Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01427)) I found the other DeepMind applications in [reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01830) and [RNN memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01822), respectively. I was coming up with a relational disentangled-attention type method for use as "relational representations" in a long-term episodic memory, and later how to innovate MHDPA for that purpose, a consideration that led to the innovation I evaluated on a question-answering dataset for my Semantic Parsing semester project, which outperformed the baseline MHDPA. I submitted my [paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgmmzgsrctmg#6cd1b9) to the next year's ICML conference. The reviewers hadn't heard of MHDPA, compared it to other preexisting attention mechanisms, and critiqued that I didn't have enough experiments. <!-- Adding experiments, back then though, wasn't so easy, because infrastructures for transformers and those benchmarks didn't exist. I programmed in TensorFlow 1.0 and Sonnet, in 2018. Furthermore, it would have gone deep into-the-weeds of something I wasn't primarily building the method for, so I proceeded with a mix of my own plans, as much bigger obstacles added themselves from the medical system, an unforeseeable change involving Henry's employment, and hugely-intensive demands that followed, not just benzos, but in vast majority consequences from benzos, and by the time transformers exploded, the method lost relevance in a saturated field, and I'd already been put on multiple new intensive projects that I didn't have much choice in. By the time I had a chance, I was now answering much more heavily to an overseeing authority, and tried to find time for other research directions that, unlike my method from 2018, at that point were still looking far ahead beyond where the rest of the research zeitgeist was. I didn't realize for a long time that I was the first to innovate on MHDPA, and that if not for the coercion of benzos, I would have very plausibly gotten credit for it.-->

<!--
Henry and I both didn't have experience with deep learning prior to when I entered the PhD program. Up until that summer before my first year as a PhD student, I had been working with random forest models. I had to teach myself — really quickly —  and through hard-to-believe intuition, the full state of the art and then some as I started the program, as I took grad-level depth and "breadth" courses, none of which at the University of Rochester were especially helpful, and my professors and students around me had very little to offer.

That being said, and most CS students can relate to this: in college, most of what I learned was self-taught. That of course didn't change in the PhD program, as the professors were still bad teachers, except also didn't know anything about the material that would need to be taught, the state of the art of their own fields, yet. 

I'm not trying to be mean to anybody. This is the truth. It's hard to express, because it implies that the world is bad, that people with authority are stupider than they're credited and esteem themselves, that they're not just stupid, but actually really, really, like really stupid, and in vast majority. THAT might make writing and reading this hard. It might make it hard to believe, if you haven't seen this for yourself, as a student. I'd say the same about the other PhD students though. I'd say this about every professor and PhD student who was in the CS department. Not personally, not that they're always stupid, but that, in general, they were. Undergrads maybe see grad students as knowing so much more, but those grad positions, and professorial, don't require intelligence to earn, usually. In most cases, actual intelligence, or anything actually novel, would get in the way.

Most people get into those positions through natural memorization ability, or obsessive memorization, and then make some minor deviations from what was taught to them that they call research, and that combination of memorization and very-linear tinkering gets esteemed if they're able to write it up in the standard academic jargon. That last part — jargon — is most of what academia beyond the memorization-stage requires. Even those professors who make a dent, often get there by luck, usually around a really simple idea sufficiently complicatedly executed.

In med school, the ability to memorize which prescriptions correspond to which diagnoses, and which diagnoses correspond to which symptoms, and which anatomical events correspond to which symptoms, is something ChatGPT-like AIs can pass [exceptionally](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18416), with [even better bedside manner](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00099-4).
-->

I went to a conference that year, NeurIPS, 2018, in Montreal. At the time it was called "NIPS, 2018." I met the DeepMind researcher Ryan Faulkner, who co-authored the [RNN memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01822) paper, that innovated on the RNN cell by applying internally the MHDPA method, who was so impressed with me, perhaps because of the really-concept-understanding comment I made at his poster session about disentangling something in their memory cell to improve their method (independent to what I'd been researching, completely to do with his method), that he invited me to lunch, and during lunch, as we were talking, he said he would recommend me to a position at DeepMind if I applied, back in 2018. 

I was walking around Montreal with headphones in my ears, listening to Of Montreal by momentum from listening to it by coincidence before the conference, and working, working really hard, in my hotel there. There was a group chat for people visiting for the conference, and lots of social events that I missed. I wanted to go to a hot tub party, but ended up working. I wanted to go to "strip karaoke," but was practicing strict ascetic disciplines, and asked the I Ching. The I Ching gave a resounding no. On the floor of my hotel, I cast the Feng Shui coins, and got the ominous hexagram "Decrease," and to my regret (having never gone to anything like either of those things), I listened, stayed in isolation, and worked. The snow outside was beautiful, and at least I walked from time to time to explore and to get groceries. "Organic" food is apparently called "biologique" in French.

I met Jürgen Schmidhuber in the conference itself, at his talk, was the last in line, had to wait longer than everybody, then talked to him a bit, he was friendly, and he shook my hand. I sent him a followup email, he replied, and it meant a lot to me.

I was wearing a hat all through the conference, to cover up my baldness, that I still wasn't used to, and still am not. It was winter, and the winter hat didn't look too out of place. Early December, weeks before my psychosis and RGH hospitalization.

The encroaching mental state on the social and self-image-based fronts began its march from the hair loss.

When I returned, my isolation on the work-based front deepened, as I was getting ready to submit my MHDPA innovation paper, coinciding with my first-ever hospitalization, the second time my frontier research ideas coincided with a sudden major health crisis, either 100% externally caused in the first instance, or unprecedented and highly dissociated from me, as in, suspiciously unlike me, in this instance.

I was also doing yoga, together with meditation and pranayama, every day, intensely and in deep trance through each session, by myself on a yoga mat or the floor, a yoga taught to me through the advanced technique of TM, that was being taught in tandem with a meditation retreat at a zen center I went on, earlier on my 23rd birthday, on November 18, 2018, where one of the instructors actually learned that it was my birthday and brought me cake and got everybody to sing happy birthday for me. It turned out, rather ironically/unfortunately, it was somebody else's birthday that day or weekend, too, who was in the large dining area where the instructor brought me a cake, announced to everybody (against my will) that it was my birthday, and they all sang to me, but not to him (not knowing it was his birthday). He later told me, with good humor. Most (well, definitely all) of the people there were older than me.

This period was an extremely isolated time of work and esoteric in-the-weeds revelation. Besides stacks of printed academic papers, I was reading The Lord of the Rings, and there was one chapter that I read precisely in this narrow time span after I returned from Montreal, "The Passage of the Marshes," that resonated for its eerie imagery. 

Frodo and Sam are being led by Gollum through the Dead Marshes. It's an eerie chapter, as Gollum's world seems to be the ruling one now, and Frodo and Sam are navigating at his back through the boggy peril.

I was going deeper and deeper into a psychotic state, both of (a) brilliant awareness and foresight about my field's fundamental principles and trajectory, and (b) isolation, as if I was traversing by the lead of Gollum through the Dead Marshes.

### Flying colors

The first psychiatrist and I walked together in the hall and he thought I was bright. The social lubricant of benzos gave me a visibly colorful brilliance that I think he reacted to as authoritative, about my knowledge of benzos and intelligence. Let's call this luminescence "flying colors," a term I'm borrowing from Henry. The first psychiatrist said I'd be weaned off before the discharge, and that was the schedule. I was able to articulate colorfully to him with an intimate/earnest social charm that I wanted to be weaned off from the drugs before discharge. He reassured, I would be weaned off before discharge.

The second psychiatrist, an Asian woman, looked stern and astute, came in on the momentum of her previous post, and without much thought just changed the schedule. She was standing next to the first psychiatrist, who hesitantly, self-doubtingly told her that he'd planned to taper me off before the discharge since I was worried, but she was dismissive, about the original plan and our preferances in that regard. She said the tapering schedule was too fast and the outpatient doctor, the psychiatrist after the hospitalization, would wean me off, but this time, she gave the reassurance, to me, that I'd be tapered right after discharge.

They didn't question if the diagnoses, in particular "catatonia," were actually what I went through. I didn't know the specific definition of catatonia, which is what the benzos were meant to treat, but adherence to yogic-type senses, delusional or not, safe to intervene on with drugs or not, isn't the same as catatonia. The other diagnosis from the medical record was "bipolar mania," for which I was being given Risperdals, a strong antipsychotic.

I wasn't asked what happened to me. It was as if "catatonia" and "bipolar mania" were the only description needed, indubitably exhaustive. Were I asked, I'm not sure I'd have been able to explain it to them, necessarily. The preceding trauma took the last 5 years for me to process into a form that I could write, let alone speak, let alone boil down into a spoonful under pressure, and the pressure was higher with each subsequent psychiatrist because my "flying colors" were increasingly faded. Depending on which version of this book you are reading, that crisis might not be described at all, here.

None of the previous diagnoses from the first hospitalization, none of what RGH wrote, were investigated or asked about in any extent by the University of Rochester’s psychiatrists, nor were either of them precisely true (at least "catatonia"). None of the events were inquired about more than what was known by RGH (essentially just the two diagnoses, as perceived).

The euphoria was turning into grey cloud and fog. I was in cognitive decline by the second psychiatrist. Then, after I was discharged, more cognitive impairment and anxiety, excruciating anxiety and [a constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/) that persisted for more than a year. The color film had faded, the "flying colors" had faded. It was Dorothy in reverse. The psychiatric unit was the "Wonderful Land of Oz," with me colorfully drunk on the magic benzos they were giving me at threatened risk of court order, and by the third <!--pen--> click of the third "healer," the tornado had begun. The third psychiatrist, the outpatient doctor, also University of Rochester, was categorically, unallegorically bad. If there could be a DSM-5 yellow-brick-manual definition for bad, it would just be a picture of him. In the second month with him, 3 months into the benzos, my cognition was not just grey but Requiem For A Dream-grey, anxiety constant. [My memory, speech, and imagination were gone](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/316ec47a-248e-4141-9eb7-5888bc1ea93d). From his disbelieving clinical authority, all of my symptoms were, wrongly, attributed to the earlier diagnoses. I told him I thought I was brain damaged, and that I was in physical pain, that I had [tinnitus](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/j1finq/tinnitus_in_just_left_ear/), and that I'd read from multiple scientific studies that [brain damage from benzos may be permanent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10309976/), and he didn't care about the scientific studies I may have hypothetically read, because every word I said was devoid of believability — not colorless from outside, but agitated/irky/murky, like my inner anxiety was attacking him. So he reacted by saying that increasing the dose would be the best course of action. I begged him to taper, and he said if I was having all those negative symptoms, that he should increase the dose, which I had to submit my position on, out of fear that he would. 

He wanted to increase the dose, as if that would reduce my brain's increasing system-wide downregulation of GABA, rather than worsen its effort to fight the dysregulation. In case you're wondering, he was an idiot. The brain damage, and literally — when memory, speech, and imagination are all impaired, and the patient's in pain, *the brain is damaged* — risked being permanent and irreversible, according to [(many) studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15762814/) I found and the [fact that nobody understands neurodegeneration](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-024-03437-5). 

I write this with the same truth value as "the Holocaust was bad": I should've weaned myself off then, or better yet, immediately, as soon as I could've started weaning. The brain's GABA being downregulated is like living in an active war zone. Coercively induced, it is, without exaggeration, a legalized form of torture, neurochemical waterboarding, except the effect persists beyond each cranium drowning, without a moment's break for air. By the next month with that doctor, around month 4 of the benzos, I wasn't able to recall well even important personal memories or easily do basic math, grey cognition, non-stop anxiety, non-stop torture. My writing quality went extremely down on anything that was social or creative or new. What I suffered was physiologically brain damage. 

My cognition and perception deteriorated severely, and [a constant rightward spinning sensation](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/h8n3ve/lopsided_and_slanted_kundalini_sensations/), [tinnitus](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/j1finq/tinnitus_in_just_left_ear/), mouth dryness, and [wrinkles](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) added to the mounting evidence of damages happening not just to my psyche, but to my brain and body. I was in severe pain and agony. He responded with only authority, no reasoning, and no sensitivity. He didn't believe any of my arguments. He made no consideration to the possibility that I was right or he was wrong. His clinical authority meant more to him than my agony. His perpetuation and amplification of my suffering, attributed reasons (despite good arguments that I made, but which were too agitated for the foolish authority), and fears was afforded to him only by his disbelief and my drug-induced insecurity about weaning off by myself. The third psychiatrist, is like Schindler's List-grey, like not even a little girl carrying an umbrella. I saw him for about 4 or 5 months and don't remember his name, which is too bad, or I would write it here in capital letters.

- The drug empire was disguised as the University of Rochester.
- The drug dealers were disguised as the University of Rochester's psychiatrists.
- The benzo drug market is a $3 billion industry disguised as the University of Rochester's medicine. 

Suspiciously, there were even contradictions in recent studies from previous decades, on the same drugs: ["the Medical Research Council (MRC) in Britain agreed in 1982 that there should be large-scale studies to examine the long-term impact of benzodiazepines after research by a leading psychiatrist showed brain shrinkage in some patients similar to the effects of long-term alcohol abuse."](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/side-effects/201011/pharmaceutical-scandal-in-britain-sheds-disturbing-new-light) The study was buried: ["The only problem with the MRC's response to such warnings about benzos? It appears to have sat for thirty years on the very documents that warned about the risks of brain shrinkage in patients taking them. Moreover, the MRC appears to have marked the documents 'closed until 2014,' despite their obvious importance to public health. [...] 'Members of Parliament and lawyers,' she continues, 'described the recently revealed documents as a scandal, and predicted they could lead the way to a class action costing millions.'"](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/side-effects/201011/pharmaceutical-scandal-in-britain-sheds-disturbing-new-light)

What could've caused three psychiatrists, with zero consensus between each other, and zero consent from the patient, to cause so much damage? I suspect the >5 months of inconsistent psychiatrist and doctor plans were due to the self-reinforcing biases clinicians (in the general sense) can create in themselves as they change a patient's personality through chemical interventions. My personality started very charming and cheerful due to the benzos, at which point they still planned to wean me off within the hospital. Then fear and anxiety rose due to increasing downregulation. As those induced neurological changes "doctored" my perception and psyche, my believability lessened (due solely to reduced neurological function, not any fundamental behavioral change aside from mental impairment, and no catatonia, or mania, or delusion), and each changing shift of psychiatrists extended the asserted duration of the coerced prescription of the previous, changing the plans of the previous psychiatrists, culminating with the outpatient doctor only willing to increase, with no taper schedule on the planned horizon. Doctors are aggressively playing Gods, and have no understanding of the severe bias that their own interventions produce in their own or each other's clinical decision-making. Measurement-bias is a known problem in science. Detection can result in a change in the state of the physical system (or organism or body) being detected. In medicine, this problem is less widely understood since the subjects being observed, detected, analyzed, judged, and changed are people.

As these months progressed, my [facial structure changed, wrinkled and my face rapidly lost a healthy appearance](https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1dyn2es/comment/lce3ie3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), so much so as even my advisor remarked, empathetically, "You look terrible." Measuring damages to an intelligent person's intelligence fully is impossible. I was able to get straight A’s in my grad level classes, TA a class, and pass an area exam in the time that I was brain damaged, even worse than I'm describing now. And that took a lot of resourcefulness, will, and spirit, like Matt-Damon-potatoes-on-Mars kind of human spirit, that can't be underestimated. But if *those* grad-level metrics can’t measure the damage to my cognitive functioning, how could the tests that psychiatric researchers who believe benzos "can be safely taken for years" have? My grandma, in her early and later dementia, passed every test, like picking between two index cards about a color previously shown or reciting numbers that the doctor had just cited, and unambiguously to both family *and doctors* had dementia, dementia, the worst possible case scenario of this, and one that [studies have also shown benzos contribute to the likelihood of in elderly people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325366/) — and for that matter, how have any psychiatric research protocols evaluated whether somebody taking benzos in their 20s doesn't contribute to the likelihood of their dementia in their 80s? My family is intelligent, and we have a lot of will to work really hard. My friend, who was triple-majoring at the University of Rochester, told me she was driving once on acid. I was like, "Really, how?" and she said, "It's mostly muscle memory..." In other words, even under an extraordinarily altered state of consciousness, like the kind induced by acid, she would still plausibly be able to pass a driving test, and the same is true for drugs that alter one's consciousness, body, and neurology harmfully. No existing set of tests can measure how much an intelligent person's life, personality, cognition, and everything by which they live by, can be destroyed by the damages that psychiatric drugs cause which are hard to articulate and express in the midst of subjectively, even when those damages are extremely overt, and are incredibly insidious to the "more objective" tests that psychiatric researchers have, tests that try to come up with a metric for intelligence, the solution to which (used as a label source for a differentiable discriminator) would literally solve all of AI. 

ChatGPT, perhaps itself a wizard behind the curtain — an artificial program — could pass their human cognition or psychiatric tests with flying pixels, probably better than a human in good health.

Until recently, [lobotomies](https://psychcentral.com/blog/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy) and [conversion therapies](https://time.com/6344824/how-common-is-conversion-therapy-united-states/) were standard psychiatric practice. Coercion in psychiatric medicine, especially long-term, especially of benzos will be recognized by medicine as barbaric.

As it turns out, the disorder was with the psychiatrists all along. "Toto, we're not in Xanax anymore," the University of Rochester medical system says to itself, as it peddles more big pharma flying monkeys. When the prison guards are criminals and the prisoners are saints, things are backwards. Likewise, when the doctors are drug dealers and the patients would be regarded in Tibet or other cultures as showing early signs of shamanic intuitions (as both Jeremiah and Sarah did, I later came to learn from direct undeniable experience with them, and as [others who presented similar symptoms to mine](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-) did, myself included), there's a disorder *of* the system, and it's not one that's classified in the DSM-5.

At after the 6 month point, I gradually reduced the dose, now entering the ["hungover" chemical waterboarding phase](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/cksl7u/health_disaster_brain_damage_alopecia_universalis/).

Starting some months [(maybe 4th month) into taking the benzos](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/cdmid6/is_extreme_brain_fog_normal_before_even_beginning/), before I began weaning, I was laying on the couch, immobilized, shaking with excruciating agony. No sleep, no escape. No exit, just PhD work (yes, and not easily — like literally fighting through my will and peak of human spirit) and torture. Skin dry, teeth calcifying (at a dental cleaning appointment, the hygienist diagnosed it as calcification and the attributed cause as dry mouth due to benzodiazepines), no memory, no linguistic expression, cognition completely grey and burning. All color gone, all imagery, all imagination, only pain, perpetual pain and fear. Terror. Terror terror terror. I remember one day trying to do $4*7$, and not being able to. They say the only thing to fear is fear itself: GABA downregulation is fear itself. The experience is like being in a warzone. It's like burning alive — without stop — more than a year, torture ([even at lower comparative doses than what I took](https://youtu.be/laheAXdZK7w?si=FuPXGh1cLuuvtfHW)). The neurochemical experience is literally what you go through if you're in a warzone, and being chased by a predator, while in the middle of having a seizure: hellfire, indescribable pain. I remember staying up nights shaking, just shaking, electricity swarming through me, my face curled, deformed as I tensed and agonized all night unless I got some sleep if I was lucky and then waking up feeling like that, again, for the rest of the day, every day, for months like this. 

I remember trying CBD oil or L-theanine to try to sleep. Latter didn't work — the CBD oil, which I got from that herbal apothecary near the house on May St., when I stopped in because I didn't know that building had become a herbal apothecary, helped a little, and after I talked with the store workers about the different herbs and chemicals they had with probably way more knowledge than they expected, the person at the counter asked to add me as a friend on Facebook, which was serendipitous and miraculous for me, but then she stopped replying as soon as I messaged suggesting they host meditations in the park next door because my wording/thinking was probably [awkward](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/), due to literal brain damage from the benzos. The personality consequences of the extreme [anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/dzx7or/not_to_get_into_toxic_territory_but_sometimes_i/), [brain fog](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/comments/cdmid6/is_extreme_brain_fog_normal_before_even_beginning/), and [impaired speech](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/316ec47a-248e-4141-9eb7-5888bc1ea93d), plus total hair loss, harmed my social life more than can be stated, and lasting trauma regarding people from the interactions with the psychiatrists and medical staff coercions.

These symptoms [persisted](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/dyaf8n/constant_chest_pain_that_spikes_into_my_neck/) for more than a year, and the trauma persists. <!-- I've read former cocaine and heroin addicts anecdotally report that long-term benzo neurotoxicity involves more horrific suffering than withdrawal from cocaine or heroin. --> I saw anecdotes in [this forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadPill/) from former addicts of heroin or cocaine who were on benzos, who reported that those side effects and withdrawals <!-- of benzo-induced GABA downregulation --> were worse than the side effects and withdrawals that they had suffered from heroin or cocaine (and similar type anecdotal reports elsewhere, e.g., probably abundant [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/benzorecovery/)).<!-- I'm sure there isn't an experience on this Earth that is worse, humanly or cosmically possible (a year without sleep, non-stop neurochemical fire, not sure that's even imaginable). -->

You know, the way I learned about the calcification was because chunks of what I thought were tooth were falling out. Just chunks of tooth-like pieces from my mouth. So I went to the dental hygienist and she said it was de-calcification. This was already when I was starting to recover to some extent, when I was already on the steak-only diet. To reiterate: it started *de*-calcifying at that point. The calcification built up a lot during the 6 months I was on benzos. That was her diagnosis: calcification due to dry mouth from benzos. The steak-diet saved my teeth, I think.

I tried to kill myself, and my family took the helium tank away.

I had to buy waist straps to finally start to recover because I couldn't sit up from the debilitated position I shook with anxiety in on the couch.

The steak diet, which I began after the severest of these symptoms and withdrawing from benzos, in spring, 2020, helped my cognitive/energy/mood recovery.

And after all of this, [literally nothing was cured](https://www.reddit.com/r/kundalini/comments/kvbjhs/does_anyone_feel_physically_moved_by_some/). Which reality — theirs, wherein these conditions are accidents that need to be militantly defeated (wherein meditation, yoga, good social life, intelligence, healthy Paleo diet, and maybe even an antipsychotic wouldn't suffice), or mine, wherein their practices are full of "psychiatric disorder" (and, as will be shown, more than just psychiatric, but environmental, dietary, social, and more) — makes more sense?

The trauma I went through during my psychosis (which the psychiatrists didn't even know about) doesn't compare to the >year of benzo neurochemical torture. 

### Nails

In addition to losing all of my hair — head, eyebrows, and eyelashes — due to the Dupilumab cessation, I also lost my fingernails in functionality in later 2018, also unambiguously due to the Dupilumab cessation. They regrew, healthily functional enough, after being purple, and bendy like putty, for a really long time, maybe into 2019. 

Without hair, without eyebrows and eyelashes, with even my grandma's fingernails purple and bending out of my nails, and isolation and heavy workloads, just what I needed was a >6 months course of benzos to get all the symptoms of early-onset dementia.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Jeremiah
>
> I ordered a margarita in a 2016 birthright Israel trip (a program that I really like, since otherwise I might've not been able to afford to go on any vacations), with Jeremiah probably somewhere at the table, thinking I was ordering a drink, and they brought me just this big margherita pizza. That's a fun story. Combined with benzos, that is, if I took my prescription for social anxiety that day, I suppose the effect would've been worse, neurologically and physically, than if they brought me a margarita.
>
> That was also the trip where I was complaining [my hair was too long](https://www.facebook.com/share/qQqsQLv4Cgvbv7UZ/), perhaps another almost-preternatural-seeming omen that preceded the [very vivid nightmare that I had](#part-1).
>
> And we all got extremely sick, suddenly, everyone on our bus, 10 plus people, 10 - 30 people, originating from a guy on the trip who wasn't me or Jeremiah. My cousin Irina, who went with me, and I, got the most sick, of the whole bus, really severe fever, sneezing, sinuses, coughing, vomiting, more. I recall she was even prescribed an opioid, besides Sudafed.
>
> About two years after my first Strong Hospital hospitalization, Jeremiah, who I hadn't seen since the trip to Israel, commented on a Facebook post that I'd made about the trauma that benzos induced on me, about some of his experiences. He wrote publicly on my post about how some psychiatric medication he had to take caused him to have a seizure. "[...] I've had bad side effects from medications that caused me to have a seizure one time that was no fun. [...]" Benzos, one of the drugs he was prescribed and the only plausible culprit of the ones he told me, [cause seizures during the brain's GABA downregulation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21815323/#:~:text=Withdrawal%20seizures%20have%20occurred%20with,time%20and%20at%20high%20doses.), a widely suffered and standardly known side effect of longer-term benzo use. Those were almost definitely the medication <!-- of his--> he was referring to.
>
> He also wrote how he was held down and choked, on pavement outside, after being tackled, on the hard rough pavement, by the university-hospital police officers, when he tried to make a run for it. "I tried to escape and they held me down and choked me. I got to the driveway [...]" Analogously, my next hospitalization also involved combative resistance to hospitalization, following the >year of benzo-induced torture. In October, 2020, I was also physically coerced by the police, due to having a "breakdown," I suppose it can be called — quiet, peaceful, and spiritually-guided — in the grass of my apartment complex, where I’m pretty sure I was legally allowed to, or within perimeters. Efforts to escape medical custody might have other causes besides bravery and spirituality (if one is willing to extend the benefit of the doubt that I’m not stupid), for example (1) induced by disinhibitions from prescribed pharmaceutical drugs, or (2) the quality of the care provided within medical custody, or other snowballing longer-term medical-institution causes, such as (3) resistance due to earlier trauma from a previous medical intervention, like the benzo coercion that traumatized me. So, in consequence, the medical application of police brutality can result as one of the negative side effects of a pharmaceutical drug, wherein the medical system is committing physical violence in order to reinforce the drug, care, or practice that led to their own physical violence or the patient's combative resistance. They also are very coercive inside the hospital, especially in the early transit before the psychiatric unit, e.g., making you sit in one place, wear what they want you to wear, take the drugs they give you or otherwise be injected with them, etc.

## Geriatric unit hospitalization

> [!WARNING]
> In December, 2020, about a month after Tayler blocked me, I had another hospitalization, my last hospitalization, the geriatric unit (elderly facility) one.
>
> I was leading another one of Chenliang's students on a long-term memory paper called [Eclectic-Mem](https://github.com/slerman12/Eclectic-Mem) for Chenliang, that I still had an extremely intense amount of work to do on in order to make the ICML deadline. My family members visited. I was again following some kind of yogic-trance, but this time, much less spiritually guided. I knew that the yogic state I'd been in before was real, and I didn't want to disobey the new flow that had taken over. I was acting strange in front of the visiting family members, and my mom called the ambulance. My behavior was strange enough that the responders decided to take me to the hospital, and as they were doing so, I broke from the obedience to that pseudo-flow state and started screaming to my mom that there was an ICML paper deadline that I had to submit to. This was still 2020, months after the Taylor-CAM paper. The responders took me away, so far with no concrete reason to do so, but only my mom's call and the superficial strangeness of my behavior.
>
> In particular, what caused my mom to call the ambulance was I was doing stretches on the couch without talking to my relatives when they were talking to me. Then the strange behavior with responders, who I did talk to, and whose questions I answered normally, was that I was slightly reluctant to let them take my vitals — yes. And I quickly did let them take my vitals. They just caught that I had some reluctance and found that suspicious. So they dragged me to the ambulance, and I was screaming to my mom about the paper deadline as they did so. The ambulance drove me to the hospital, where first, they brought me to a lobby.
>
> In the lobby, the nurse pulled me behind a curtain and made me change clothes, and I didn't want to (was slightly reluctant), but she told me I had to. Then she sat me in a wheelchair. A nurse pushed it forward, it ran over my big toe, and I screamed out specifically that my toe was run over. The nurse kept rolling me off, as she and the other nurses all ignored my screaming, in what, surprisingly, didn't break my toe. 
>
> Next, they brought me to an open area filled with other patients, and told me I'd be transferred later that day.
>
> Each day I was told I’d be transferred that day or the next day. I had to sleep there in a chair for a week. The dungeon-like area was full, in every square foot of the open areas, with other patients, who slept on mattresses or also in chairs. The clinicians seemed to forget about me and still had no particular reason for the imprisonment.
>
> Besides the clothes they’d made me change into, I was given only highly processed foods to eat, foods that usually cause eczema, drugs including benzos, and periodic clinical visits from clinicians who could've been mistaken for military interrogators. Clinical authorities.
>
> None of them were consistent or attendant enough to see this, but I was in an increasingly sensitive state, as I was coerced through all of this, knowing-unjustly, and with no normal sleep for a week.
>
> After a week of sleeping in a chair, they transferred me to the geriatric unit (a facility for the elderly) on a different floor, their regular psychiatric units being full.
>
> Finally, they specified a reason for why they were holding me. Apparently my mom said I wasn't eating enough, which she later denied saying. Ironically, I was eating a lot. Usually 5 organic steaks and a salmon every day, about half of my income. I was lectured pretty heavily by a fat woman specialist about how carbs are a necessary part of a healthy diet. That was Winter, 2020/2021, perhaps just before diets like the keto diet gained scientific support, or maybe already after. During that hospitalization, chunks of my hair fell out. The rapid timing was extremely coincidental, so maybe the onset of the hair loss was independent to the hospitalization, or maybe a synchronicity, but most likely exacerbated, because I thought I was in Hell.
> 
> The anxiety was so extreme that my eczema became itchy just from that, if not the food. I ate all of their garbage food. I made special requests, but the diet they provided wasn't more than what you'd expect from hospital food, and always came with an abundance of chocolate Ensures, enough to probably buy a steak honestly.
> 
> Due to Covid, my family wasn’t allowed to visit me.
>
> Of all the hospitalizations (excluding aftermath, e.g., benzos trauma), the most traumatic was the geriatric unit one. And not because they ran over my toe with the wheelchair that I was in and ignored my pained screams, nor the enclosed-dungeon area where they made me sleep in a chair for a week, eat stuff I was allergic too, take benzos temporarily again, and share living space amid lots of commotion and tons of people, but because of the geriatric unit they subsequently transferred me to. Old people. People I thought were sketchy. One friend, black guy I shared pudding crackers with at the window later, after, when I managed to get out of my room from the trauma of thinking I was in Hell. Other than that, coldness, Hell-setting, and, while I was still confined to my bed due to the intensity of the earlier dungeon area where they kept saying they'd transfer me to a room later that day and didn't for another week, I was under the delusion in that geriatric unit environment that I was literally in Hell, the beam of red light shining into my window from the neighboring hospital roof, being stuck in a floor with no nature, old lady in the room next door screaming "Oh Christia! Oh Christia!" every day, only plastic and children's colors and an artificial picture painting across from my door. And I had a whole bed and bathroom to myself, but still. The nurses and staff were fine, but the environment was bad.
>
> That was the geriatric unit hospitalization, psychiatric wards were full, ran over my toe, they kept me in an open-room with other patients, and then after like a week of me sleeping in a chair, they transferred me to a geriatric unit, with me unable to leave my bed through New Year’s because I thought I was in Hell, once they situated me in that geriatric unit room, no visitors. They had no knowledge of that Hell thinking, nor was that my state of thinking coming into the hospitalization. 
>
> I wasn’t risking the tongue trick from before to spit out the benzos. I wasn’t in that kind of flow state. But perhaps all of this was my fault because, later, when they gave me a Covid mask, in the geriatric unit, which I don't recall if they did while in the open area with other patients, I got to spit the benzos out into that.
>
> I think they did a Covid test before transferring me, though I don't recall one. I'm just inferring, since it was a geriatric unit (a unit for the elderly). Yes, I recall mention of a Covid test. I don't know if it was before or after the dungeon-area.
>
> To summarize:
> - My big toe was painfully run over by the nurse, and ignored, no attention paid, disregarded screaming.
> - I had to sleep in a chair in a shared open area filled with other patients for a week with only scary clinical authorities who came around occasionally to interrogate me, drugs handed to me, and with food only that I was allergic to, while in an increasingly sensitive state, and being told I'd be transferred to a room later that day or the next day.
> - I was transferred to a geriatric unit, with almost nobody my age, and an environment that lacked any nature, with only synthetic plastics, no genuine warmth, and an abundance of chocolate Ensures.
> - I was lectured about not eating enough carbs.
> - My hair was falling out into my hands and my eczema returned.
>
> Some crazy-person advice: Clinicians should stop using the expression "I'm gonna take your vitals," because when a patient thinks they’re in Hell, that is a terrifying thing to hear. Then they have no choice but to let those clinicians strap them or inject them or whatever, and their mind possibly is tuned to a ritual level of thinking where symbolism has extreme sacred meaning. The symbolism of "vitals" being "taken," in the context of vampyrism or losing a loved one, isn't good. Just a suggestion. 
>
> While drugged with benzos in the enclosed-dungeon area, my brain went from that strange pseudo-schizotypal paranoia I began in to a full blown "I'm literally condemned here forever and this is literally a robot dimension or Hell" state.
>
> Since Winter, 2020/2021, I have not had another serious or psychiatric hospitalization. There was one hospitalization half a year later, in which I was there for half a day, but they neither held me there nor believed there was any psychiatric issue. The geriatric unit hospitalization was traumatizing, but that's not the reason why I successfully avoided future imprisonments. My ability to live with those schizophrenic states (trances, including less trustworthy ones), consciously and drug-free, increased to the point that they aren't schizophrenic states, but unambiguous connections to a deeper wisdom (or, some "intelligence" of some kind, depending what social influences are most authoritatively in my life). [Humans and other cultures have been integrating that wisdom long before hospitals existed.](https://youtu.be/CFtsHf1lVI4?si=c7HOzpchsB2NeP1-) Though this geriatric unit hospitalization isn't a good example, I was and have become pretty good at navigating those states of consciousness and integrating them in the moment, usefully, creatively, and sometimes powerfully.

At the end of [A Beautiful Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film)), the nobel prizewinner with schizophrenia, John Nash, is depicted as achieving stability by taking his medications. The real John Nash objected to them, and lived pretty much his entire life unmedicated, starting from long before he came up with the work that led to his winning the Nobel Prize. While the movie's depiction is somehow extremely romantic to medical systems, it's inaccurate to the true history of how he surmounted his diagnoses. ["In Sylvia Nasar’s book with the same title, on which the film is based, it is clearly stated that Nash stopped taking medication in 1970 because of the way it blunted his intellect. The change was apparently made because the screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman, whose mother was a prominent psychologist, was worried that the film might persuade people to stop taking their medication."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics) Yes, the film based on a true story might persuade people wrongly. So better fabricate it. ["in a scene [around the time of the character's Nobel nomination in 1994], Russell Crowe explicitly credits his recovery [...] to newer medication. The truth is that Nash stopped taking any medication in 1970. The line is a fabrication, and a conscious one."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics)

> ["Nash described sanity as a form of conformity, and one about which he maintained a degree of ambivalence. 'So, at the present time, I seem to be thinking rationally in the style that is characteristic of scientists,' he wrote. 'However, this is not entirely a matter of joy, as if someone returned from physical disability to good physical health. One aspect of this is that rationality of thought imposes a limit on a person’s concept of his relation to the cosmos.' There can be no doubt that to talk in such terms requires both honesty and tremendous courage. The question is whether we have the courage to hear him."](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/02/dont-use-john-nash-schizophrenia-a-beautiful-mind-promote-anti-psychotics)

To do: Make a diagram specifically for geriatric unit hospitalization (University of Rochester's Strong Hospital).

Chronology: Lobby wheelchair toe -> open-area chair sleeping with processed eczema-causing food, more coerced benzos, and interrogative military clinicians -> geriatric unit -> them arguing carbs were a necessary part of a healthy diet and stating that the reason for holding me in that hospitalization was that I wasn't eating enough (even as I ate all of their garbage food).

## Hair regrowth

Full head hair regrowth in alopecia universalis, especially with comorbid eczema, is extremely medically rare. 

I was on a mostly-steak-only diet since at least as far as June, 2020 (with wild-caught salmon as well), at which time I was working on my Taylor-CAM paper.

See [here](4-Faith.md#mikhaila-peterson) for where I'd initially heard of this diet from. Specifically, the diet I heard of and read about was "beef-only," which sounds gross.

Previous to the final version of my diet, beginning initially from Paleo, I transitioned to (organic) beef-only. The organic-beef-only phase was about a month and caused watery bowel movement symptoms and decreased stool frequency, as were expected from what I'd heard and read about the diet. By the end of that month, I think my energy and mood, and probably cognition, had massively improved. Gradually, the majority of my beef came from organic, grass fed, grass-finished steak and not long after, perhaps in that month as well, I added daily salmon in the morning. So my diet converged to one wild-caught salmon every morning and about 5 organic, grass fed, grass-finished steaks per day, and organic black pepper and salt, and water. I used lots of salt and fried the fat from the steak. 

I experienced big improvements to my cognition, energy, and mood. In particular, I recall my writing, not academic but poems, visual creative writing, and texts to people, had improved that summer to beyond even where they were before the benzo brain damage. Most of my income was going towards this experimental recovering, meant to improve my head from the benzo-induced impairments — and, unexpectedly, my hair started to grow back while on that diet within the next couple months. I was also practicing other disciplines, including meditating, calisthenics, and abstaining from porn, all of which I continued from previous to this diet.

In the October, 2020 hospitalization after the Sarah-one, [Mobi](#mobi) remarked on my hair when we saw a Duplumab commercial and I mentioned that the drug made me lose my hair ("oh that’s why"). 

I was walking around bravely sometimes, past all the nurses and patients, from my room to the phone without hat. 

[In the next hospitalization, in the geriatric unit](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization), there was a guy my age. I sat with him every day towards my last days there at the window. He and I talked. We were talking about deep things. I told him about my self-consciousness about my hair, since chunks of it were falling out again in that geriatric unit, and he said he couldn’t even tell anything was bald. I think he even had some balding that he showed me, and said that he loses hair all the time, that my hair looked good, and not to worry. In other words, my hair had fully grown back, enough to pass the eye test of a guy sitting right next to me. *My head hair had fully grown back.*

But, in case the detail was missed ("since chunks of it were falling out again in that [geriatric unit](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization)"), it was there that it turned out to be falling out again, and proceeded to partially for months after, to the point that now it looks worse than it would've had it never grown back. I have to shave it from my head, something I don't like doing, to maintain the bald upper bound of my current mutilated appearance, that otherwise now grows in in patches, with more bald skin than hairy skin. That is exponentially worse than the first time they caused my hair to fall out.

Despite my self-consciousness, for the most part, I didn't wear a hat during that hospitalization, so many people saw my head. My mom said, "I didn't think you need it" over the phone when I got mad at her for not dropping it off when she dropped off one steak in a plastic Tupperware. I was lectured about not eating enough carbs (which steak doesn't have) by one of the hospital staff. They required I eat carbs for me to be discharged, since they said my diet, and specifically that my mom told them I wasn't eating enough (which she denied), was why I was being held.

My hair was falling into my hands again in the [geriatric unit in December, 2020](#geriatric-unit-hospitalization), most likely because of the practices in that coerced hospital stay or the temporary dietary consequences of the previous coerced hospital stay.

That sudden hair regrowth was, miraculously, more than 2 years after the Dupilumab cessation that induced the alopecia universalis, and covered my head. 

## Intimacy healing

Depression, anxiety, PTSD, and [touch starvation](https://youtu.be/4zJXr4jeP5w?si=bQCCeK4_Cxv1MbL1) might be treatable through intimacy.

All three reduce consciousness, and predispose a horny person to making bad decisions, or good decisions based on a temporary need induced by confinement.

I propose a new branch of medicine called intimacy healing, one with an ontology like as follows: communications as a subset of intimacy healing, intimacy healing as a subset of medicine, with overlaps but distinction from sex work. 

Independently, sex work should be legalized, regarded as a subset of fine art, formally and academically, but distinct from intimacy healing, and the branches of medicine and fine art can overlap.

Radical idea, but that's the direction. Humans need each other. Relationships are the most fundamental part of life, more of a basic necessity than food, water, shelter, or drugs.

Perhaps my alternative would've served better, and given her a spiritual, healthy way to resolve a human struggle that all of us share.
